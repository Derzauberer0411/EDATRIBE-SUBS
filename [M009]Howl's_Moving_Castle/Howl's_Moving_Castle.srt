1
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,428
Sophie, we closed the shop.
You've done enough work.

2
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,555
Why don't you come out with us
this time?

3
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,601
No, I better finish this.
You go and have fun.

4
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,728
All right, suit yourself.

5
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,188
Let's go, girls.

6
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,564
- Wait for me!
- I'm ready.

7
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,442
- Do I look okay?
- It's Howl's castle!

8
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,485
- Where?
- Howl?

9
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,404
I've never seen it close!

10
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,158
Do you think Howl will go into town?

11
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,624
He's gone.

12
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,418
No, he's just hiding in the fog
from those planes.

13
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,338
Did you hear
what happened to Martha?

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,382
They say Howl tore her heart out.

15
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,550
- I'm scared to go out!
- What?

16
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,011
Don't worry,
he only preys on pretty girls.

17
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,223
All right, let's go.

18
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,936
You girls are mean.
It's not funny.

19
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,143
Hey. Looks like a little mouse
lost its way.

20
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,395
Oh, no, I'm not lost.

21
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,233
This little mouse looks thirsty.
We should take her for a cup of tea.

22
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,318
No, thanks, my sister's expecting me.

23
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,570
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

24
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,114
How old are you? You live around here?

25
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,033
Leave me alone.

26
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,161
You see?
Your moustache scares all the girls.

27
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,997
So? She's even cuter
when she's scared.

28
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,332
There you are, sweetheart.

29
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,918
Sorry I'm late.
I was looking everywhere.

30
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,294
Hey, we're busy here.

31
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,462
Are you really?

32
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,882
It looked to me
like the two of you were just leaving.

33
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,551
Hup!

34
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,094
Hup!

35
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,303
<i>Whoa!</i>

36
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,018
Don't hold it against them.
They're actually not all that bad.

37
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,564
Where to?
I'll be your escort this evening.

38
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,108
Oh, I'm, um, just going to the bakery.

39
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,485
Don't get alarmed,
but I'm being followed.

40
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,946
Act normal.

41
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,969
Sorry. Looks like you're involved.

42
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,057
This way.

43
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,983
Hold on.

44
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,282
Now, straighten your legs
and start walking.

45
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,540
See? Not so hard, is it?

46
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,474
You are a natural.

47
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,448
I'll make sure to draw them off.

48
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,617
But wait a bit
before you head back outside.

49
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,577
Okay.

50
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,330
That's my girl.

51
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,466
Excuse me, could we trouble
you for some more coffee?

52
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,134
- There you go.
- Do you have Lettie-shaped cookies?

53
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,804
- I'd buy those.
- Here.

54
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,347
What time do you get off?

55
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,473
She what?

56
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,643
- I'm here, where're you going?
- Hey!

57
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,564
Sophie?

58
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,817
- Lettie.
- What's going on?

59
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,653
Someone just told me
you floated down onto our balcony.

60
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,823
So that did happen. It wasn't a dream.

61
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,158
Lettie, would you like to use my office?

62
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,912
I should really get back to work.
Thank you, though.

63
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,583
Wow. He must have
been a wizard, then.

64
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,419
But he was so kind to me.

65
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,171
He rescued me, Lettie.

66
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,341
Of course he did.
He was trying to steal your heart!

67
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,760
You are so lucky, Sophie.

68
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,096
If that wizard were Howl,
he would have eaten it.

69
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,058
No, he wouldn't.
Howl only does that to beautiful girls.

70
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,852
Don't give me that.

71
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,063
You need to be more careful.
It's dangerous out there.

72
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:46,026
Even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl.

73
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,362
- Are you listening?
- Huh?

74
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,613
Ugh!

75
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,827
Lettie, the chocolate eclairs are done.

76
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,038
Okay. I'll be right there.

77
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,622
Thanks.

78
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,709
All right. I better get going then.

79
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,211
I just wanted to make sure
that you were doing okay.

80
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,549
- Hello, Lettie.
- Hi, how are you doing?

81
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,553
Sophie, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in that hat shop?

82
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,057
The shop was just
so important to Father.

83
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,641
And I'm the eldest, I don't mind.

84
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,144
I'm not asking
what Father would have wanted.

85
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,188
I want to know what you want.

86
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,481
Well...

87
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,607
See you later, Lettie.

88
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,859
- Good seeing you again.
- You, too.

89
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,612
- I better be going.
- It's your life, Sophie.

90
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,239
- Do something for yourself for once.
- Bye, Lettie.

91
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,226
I'm sorry,
but the shop's closed now, ma'am.

92
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,229
I could have sworn I locked that door.
Must have forgotten.

93
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,111
What a tacky shop.
I've never seen such tacky little hats.

94
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,282
Yet you're by far the tackiest thing here.

95
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,077
I'm afraid you will have to leave now.

96
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,502
The door's over here, ma'am.
We're closed.

97
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,048
Standing up to the Witch of the Waste,
that's plucky.

98
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,801
The Witch of the Waste?

99
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,895
The best part of that spell
is you can't tell anyone about it.

100
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,230
My regards to Howl.

101
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,422
Oh. No.

102
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,883
Oh!

103
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:20,657
That's really me, isn't it?
I've got to stay calm.

104
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,591
I've got to stay calm!

105
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,678
Now, there's no use
panicking, Sophie. Oh!

106
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,891
It's a bad dream, that's all.
Just go inside, go to bed.

107
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,020
You're gonna be fine, Sophie.
You're gonna be fine.

108
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,856
Got to stay calm.

109
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,575
Look who's here!

110
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,620
- You're back!
- Look at you!

111
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,957
What do you think?
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

112
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,166
It's gorgeous!

113
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,545
I know!
Our customers will love it! Sophie!

114
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,046
Sophie!

115
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,049
Your daughter
hasn't come downstairs yet today.

116
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,260
That's strange. I wonder what's wrong.

117
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,347
Sophie!

118
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,559
Sophie!

119
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,937
Sophie!

120
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:39,110
Don't come in here. I've got a bad cold.
I don't want you to catch it.

121
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,865
You sound ghastly,
like some 90-year-old woman.

122
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,826
I'll just stay in bed all day, so you go on.

123
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,620
Well, if you insist.

124
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,042
Up we go.

125
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,431
This isn't so bad, now, is it?
You're still in pretty good shape.

126
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,434
And your clothes finally suit you.

127
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,064
But you can't stay here like this for long.

128
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,912
Oh! Being old is worse than I thought.

129
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,129
- They say their prince is missing.
- And they're blaming us.

130
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,758
Yeah, and it sounds
like they're gonna start a war.

131
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,927
Nobody wants to go to war.

132
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,428
Let's hope
the prince turns up soon.

133
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,313
Excuse me, could you use some help?

134
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,651
I'll be fine, but thanks for offering.
That was really kind.

135
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,321
Sure, there's room in back,
but where are you headed?

136
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,990
Just a little ways farther
than where you're going.

137
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,331
You're crazy
if you do this, Grandma!

138
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,792
There's nothing but witches
and wizards out there!

139
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,253
Thank you.
I'll keep that in mind.

140
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,463
She's going to
the Wastes by herself?

141
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,049
She says she's looking
for her younger sister.

142
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,567
I'll never get there with these legs.

143
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,196
At least my teeth haven't fallen out yet.

144
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,541
That would make a nice cane.
Up we go.

145
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,710
Oh.

146
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,550
Might be too big.

147
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,854
This is one stubborn branch.

148
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,485
You're not getting the best
of this old lady.

149
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,909
Oh!

150
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,956
Just a scarecrow!

151
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,792
I was afraid you were
one of those blob men.

152
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,921
But how're you standing
on your own like that?

153
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,509
You're head's a turnip.

154
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,054
I've always hated turnips,
ever since I was little.

155
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,098
At least you're not upside down now.

156
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,850
So long.

157
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,776
It's too cold.

158
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,654
And I can still see the town.
I've barely moved.

159
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,073
Hmm?

160
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,869
Go away! Quit following me!

161
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,789
There's no need to thank me,
you don't owe me a thing.

162
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm sure you have
some kind of spell on you,

163
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,169
and I've had more than enough
of witches and spells.

164
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,340
So, just go find some field
and stand in it!

165
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,780
Thank you, this cane is perfect,
it's just what I need.

166
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,824
If you'd like to do me one more favor,

167
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,410
you could run off
and find me a place to stay.

168
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,923
I seem to have become
quite cunning in my old age.

169
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,478
A battleship! Oh!

170
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,524
Why do you get so cold
when you're old?

171
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,321
I'm fatter than ever,
yet the wind blows right through me.

172
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:52,214
Someone's got a fire going.
Maybe there's a cabin nearby.

173
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,944
You turnip-head! That's Howl's castle!

174
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,074
That is not what I meant
when I asked for a place to stay.

175
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,088
Look at that. They call this a castle?

176
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,641
Ah!

177
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,443
Is that the way in?

178
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,864
Slow down!

179
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,785
For heaven's sake.

180
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,706
Make up your mind.
Are you gonna let me in or not?

181
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,249
<i>Whoa!</i>

182
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,254
Oh, my shawl!

183
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,977
It's nice and warm in there,
so I'm going in.

184
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,312
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

185
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,483
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart
of a shriveled, old lady like me.

186
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,946
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

187
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,741
Even if you are
my least favorite vegetable.

188
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,952
Take care, Turnip-head.

189
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,357
Ah.

190
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,079
There we go.

191
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,792
What a dump.

192
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,711
When I think castle,
this is not what I picture.

193
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,974
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is nothing frightens you.

194
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,362
I don't envy you, lady.
That is one bad curse.

195
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,990
Curses are tough. You're gonna have
a hard time getting rid of that one.

196
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,535
The fire spoke!

197
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,287
The curse won't allow you
to talk about it, right?

198
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,914
Are you Howl?

199
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,793
No, I'm an extremely powerful
fire demon named Calcifer.

200
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,419
I just like to do that once in a while.

201
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,799
A fire demon. Well, then,
you should be able to break my curse.

202
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,175
Maybe, maybe not.

203
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,011
Listen, if you can find a way
to break the spell that's on me,

204
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,806
then I'll break the spell that's on you,
you got it?

205
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,226
If you're a demon,
how do I know I can trust you?

206
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,520
You promise to help me if I help you?

207
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,607
I don't know, lady.
Demons don't make promises.

208
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,693
Then go find someone else.

209
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,778
Come on! You should feel sorry for me!

210
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,699
That spell keeps me stuck in this castle,
and Howl treats me like I'm his slave.

211
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,702
It burns me up. Got to keep
the water hot, the rooms warm,

212
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,037
-keep the castle moving.
- Oh, that's rough.

213
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,622
You ever try to move a castle?

214
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,959
If you can figure out how
to break this thing I'm in with Howl,

215
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,544
then you can break my spell.

216
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,922
After that, I can easily
break the spell that's on you.

217
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,843
All right, it's a deal.

218
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,680
Hey, lady? Lady?

219
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,519
Hello? Lady? Hello? Hey, hey!
Lady? Lady?

220
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:20,482
Hey, let me get over there.
Some big help you're gonna be.

221
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,497
Hey, who's this lady?

222
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,459
- Porthaven door.
- How'd she get in here?

223
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,343
Stand by.

224
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,974
Mr. Mayor, good day.

225
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,308
Good afternoon, sir.

226
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,019
Would the great
Wizard Jenkins be at home?

227
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,605
I am afraid that my master
is out at the moment.

228
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,983
I speak for him in his absence.

229
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,821
An invitation from His Majesty the King.
The time for war is upon us.

230
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,659
His Majesty requires that every witch
and wizard aid our homeland.

231
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,912
Wizard Jenkins must report
to the palace immediately.

232
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,039
- That is all.
- War...

233
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,168
I can't believe it's come to this.

234
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,337
And what do you think
you're doing here, Grandma?

235
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,506
Calcifer said that I could come in.

236
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,093
I did not. She just wandered in here
from the Wastes.

237
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,054
She's from the Wastes?

238
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,056
How do we know that she's not a witch?

239
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,267
Do you think I'd let a witch in here?

240
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,353
Porthaven door again!

241
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,106
Must be a customer.

242
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,776
Stand by.

243
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,196
Yes, my dear child?

244
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,323
My mom sent me to pick up a spell.

245
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,493
- Ah, yes, do come in.
- Okay.

246
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,415
Just keep quiet
and don't cause any trouble, Grandma.

247
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,223
It's not the Wastes.

248
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,894
Excuse me, Granny,
are you a witch, too?

249
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,064
That's right.
I'm the scariest witch of them all.

250
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,151
Dust your ship with this powder
and the winds will favor it.

251
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,944
Thanks.

252
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,907
Farewell, child.

253
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,452
Quit telling lies to our customers.

254
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,913
What about you?
You're wearing a disguise.

255
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,123
I have to. I'm practicing my magic.

256
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,125
Hmm?

257
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,336
It's the Kingsbury door!

258
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,922
Stand by.

259
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,263
Would this be the residence
of the great Wizard Pendragon?

260
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,389
It Is.

261
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,226
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty the King.

262
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,020
Please inform Mr. Pendragon
that all witches and wizards

263
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,397
are required to report
for duty at the palace.

264
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,651
I will inform him right away.

265
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,751
This is the royal city, isn't it?

266
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,380
Move it, Grandma,
or you'll lose your nose.

267
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,678
And stop wandering around!

268
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,259
Leave it alone, Grandma.
I'm getting angry.

269
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,470
- This is a magic house, isn't it?
- Oh!

270
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,056
So, tell me,
where does the black one lead?

271
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,641
Only Master Howl knows that.

272
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,437
I need some breakfast. I'm starved.

273
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,323
Don't you want to have
some bacon and eggs?

274
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,827
Yeah, but we can't use the fire.
Master Howl's not here.

275
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,082
Don't worry, I can cook.

276
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:33,378
It doesn't matter.
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

277
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,923
That's right, lady.
I'm not taking orders from you.

278
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,135
Oh, there's my hat.

279
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,721
That's better.

280
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,724
All right, Calcifer. Let's get cooking.

281
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,394
I don't cook!
I'm a scary and powerful fire demon!

282
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,191
How would you like a bucket
of cold water in your face?

283
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,736
Or maybe I should tell Howl about
our bargain?

284
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,824
Oh! Stupid me!
I never should have let her in here.

285
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,744
So, what'll it be?

286
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,458
That's right. That's a good fire.

287
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,421
Here's another curse.
May all your bacon burn.

288
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,799
Calcifer's doing what she says.

289
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,760
I think I'd like some tea, too.
Do you have a kettle?

290
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,388
- Sure.
- Hey, what are you doing?

291
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,932
Don't get the kettle!
Who's side are you on, anyway?

292
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,058
<i>Mark), what are you doing?</i>

293
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,393
Huh?

294
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,731
Master Howl,
the king's messengers were here.

295
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,775
They said you have to report
to the palace

296
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,361
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

297
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,125
Calcifer? You're being so obedient.

298
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,085
Not on purpose. She bullied me.

299
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,422
Not just anybody can do that.

300
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,340
And you are who?

301
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,677
Uh, you can just
call me Grandma Sophie.

302
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,388
I'm your new cleaning lady.
I just started work today.

303
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,098
Give that to me.

304
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,433
Oh!

305
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,147
Hand me two more slices of that bacon
and six more of those eggs.

306
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,581
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

307
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,542
Mmm.

308
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,545
Yummy.

309
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,096
So, then, who hired you to clean?

310
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:53,018
Uh, Calcifer did.
He's disgusted by how dirty it is in here.

311
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,603
Hmm.

312
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,105
<i>Mark), get the plates.</i>

313
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,903
Wait a second, you're all gonna eat
while I do all the work?

314
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,614
Come have
some breakfast, Sophie.

315
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,954
Take a seat. Hmm.

316
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,844
Which do you want?

317
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,097
You only get one
'cause the rest are dirty.

318
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,102
Looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

319
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,689
- Bread, Markl?
- Thanks.

320
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,777
- Sophie?
- Yes, thank you.

321
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,907
- So, friends, enjoy. Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

322
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,451
I can't remember the last time
we had a real breakfast.

323
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,586
Even the manners are a mess
in this house.

324
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,006
So, what do you have hidden
in your pocket, Sophie?

325
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,134
Huh? Oh...

326
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,728
- What is this?
- Give it to me.

327
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,938
Hmm.

328
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,606
Oh!

329
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,613
Scorch marks.
Howl, can you read them?

330
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,075
That is ancient sorcery.
And quite powerful, too.

331
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,952
It's from the Witch of the Waste?

332
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,038
"You who swallowed a falling star,

333
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,959
"O heartless man,
your heart shall soon belong to me."

334
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,752
That can't be good for the table.

335
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,351
Wow! It's gone!

336
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,021
The mark may be gone,
but the spell is still there.

337
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,900
Excuse me, my friends,
please continue your meal.

338
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,070
Calcifer, move the castle
60 miles to the west.

339
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,495
And while you're at it,
make hot water for my bath.

340
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,664
Fine. Like moving the castle
isn't hard enough?

341
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,167
You're not working for
the Witch of the Waste, are you?

342
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,006
I would never work for that witch!
She's the one who...

343
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,596
I'm actually a...

344
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,437
If I ever get my hands on that witch,
I'm going to wring her fat neck!

345
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,440
Finish your breakfast!

346
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,237
I've had enough of this!

347
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,865
You bugs better run
before I bite your heads off!

348
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,453
I'm sick of being treated
like some timid little old lady.

349
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,544
Hello, sir, is my potion ready?

350
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,089
Come back later.
There's a witch on a rampage in there.

351
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,682
Sophie, please!

352
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,851
Sophie! Please help me. I'm going out!

353
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,730
Please, get me some firewood, quick!

354
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,150
Hey, please help me.
Wait, what are you doing?

355
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,820
Don't! I'll fall! You crazy lady with tongs!

356
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,405
- You'll be fine.
- I'll fall! Help!

357
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,906
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

358
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,995
No, I'm not fine!
Please! I'm going out!

359
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,791
Please. I'm falling.

360
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,587
Help, I'm falling!

361
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:56,928
Sophie, hurry up, please.
Hurry, please.

362
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,473
<i>Whoa!</i>

363
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:23,330
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't torment my friend.

364
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,003
Master Howl, are you going out now?

365
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:37,218
Markl, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

366
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,350
Sophie, what did you do now?

367
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,852
She almost smothered me!

368
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,064
If I die, Howl dies, too, I hope you know.

369
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,524
Oh, be quiet. You're all right.

370
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,486
Now quit bothering me,
I've got a job to do.

371
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,530
Wait, you can't come up here!

372
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,617
Whatever you don't want me to clean,
better hide it now.

373
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,079
Save my room for last, okay?

374
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,918
These little outbursts
seem to be giving me some energy.

375
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,840
What a mess.

376
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,434
Oh!

377
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,401
Oh!

378
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:56,297
Incredible! Calcifer! Calcifer!

379
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,925
Are you the one moving the castle?

380
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,219
Of course. No one
else does any work around here.

381
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,804
I am thoroughly impressed!

382
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,891
You are a first-class fire demon.
I like your spark.

383
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,814
She likes my spark! Ha-ha!

384
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,573
Ah! Not ready! Not ready!

385
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,939
It's beautiful.

386
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,650
Yeah. It's called Star Lake.

387
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,948
Hey, what's that stick doing in there?

388
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,203
Oh, dear. Give me a hand, Markl.

389
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,628
It's a scarecrow.

390
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,922
Yep, I've been calling him Turnip-head.

391
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,925
Somehow he always manages
to get stuck upside down.

392
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,979
He keeps following me everywhere.
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

393
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,649
That's weird. Are you sure
you're not a witch, Sophie?

394
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,444
Oh, yes! I'm the worst kind
of witch ever, the kind that cleans.

395
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,560
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head!

396
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,029
I think he likes doing the laundry.

397
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,949
Looks like he'll have it dry in no time.

398
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:34,247
I bet he's some kind of demon.
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him at all.

399
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,667
You're right. He probably is a demon.

400
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,589
But he led me here,
So maybe he's the good kind.

401
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,341
We got all the laundry
put away, Sophie.

402
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,926
Oh, thank you, Markl.

403
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,180
When you're old, all you want
to do is stare at the scenery.

404
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,517
It's so strange,
I've never felt so peaceful before.

405
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,264
Whew.

406
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,267
You okay? I mean, you smell terrible.

407
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,828
You shouldn't keep flying around
like that.

408
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,290
Soon you won't be able
to turn back into a human.

409
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,130
Isn't this great?
Sophie put these here for me.

410
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,676
This war is terrible.

411
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,512
They've bombed from the southern
coast to the northern border.

412
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,972
It's all in flames now.

413
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,683
I can't stand the fire in gunpowder.

414
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,519
Those dopey guys
have absolutely no manners.

415
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,230
My own kind attacked me today.

416
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,857
- Who, the Witch of the Waste?
- No,

417
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,277
some hack wizards who turned
themselves into monsters for the king.

418
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,530
Those wizards are going
to regret doing that.

419
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,075
They'll never change back into humans.

420
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,286
After the war,
they won't recall they ever were human.

421
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,372
Hey, aren't you supposed
to report to the king, too?

422
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,667
I'm tired.
Make some hot water for my bath.

423
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,669
What? Not again.

424
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,787
- Is Howl back?
- Yes.

425
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,206
He's wasting all my hot water again.

426
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,796
I don't know why we're doing this.

427
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,714
Master Howl hardly eats.

428
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,924
Too bad.

429
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,301
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

430
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:03,391
Don't you love early morning markets?
And just look at the water!

431
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,769
I've never seen the ocean before!
It's beautiful!

432
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,229
It always looks like that.

433
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,491
- Hmm. I hate potatoes.
- Pay up.

434
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,411
- Thanks, have a nice day.
- Come again.

435
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,748
All our fish
were caught fresh this morning.

436
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,627
Hmm, I hate fish.

437
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,629
One of our ships is in the harbor!

438
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,964
It looks like it's on fire!

439
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,091
Looks like there's been a serious battle.

440
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,927
What happened?
Sorry, lady, we're closed.

441
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
The ship, it's sinking!

442
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,370
Come on, Sophie, let's get a better look.

443
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,124
No, I've seen all I can take.
Let's go home.

444
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,835
I can't believe it.
It's our most advanced battleship.

445
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,342
The witch's henchmen are here.

446
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,469
- What?
- Quiet down.

447
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,430
They're only a few feet away.

448
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,686
He's gone.

449
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,314
I don't understand why
no one else seemed to notice him.

450
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,988
Look! There they are!

451
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,032
That plane!
That's what dropped the bombs!

452
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,076
Look, Sophie. It's the enemy's airship!

453
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,833
Sophie! Wait up! Sophie!

454
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,878
Ignore the flyers.
They're enemy propaganda.

455
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,426
Sophie, are you okay?

456
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,768
I just need a glass of water.

457
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,520
I'll get it.

458
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,415
Sophie! You sabotaged me! Look!
Look what you've done to my hair!

459
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,250
Look!

460
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,295
- What a pretty color.
- It's hideous!

461
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:40,381
You completely ruined
my magic potions in the bathroom.

462
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,135
I just organized things, Howl,
nothing's ruined.

463
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,053
Wrong! Wrong!

464
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,932
I specifically ordered you
not to get carried away!

465
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,895
Now I'm repulsive.
I can't live like this.

466
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,232
Come on, it's not that bad.

467
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:09,076
You should look at it now.
This shade is even better.

468
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,078
I give up.

469
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,040
I see no point in living
if I can't be beautiful.

470
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,721
Howl, cut it out. Howl, no, stop it.

471
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,681
He's calling the Spirits of Darkness.

472
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,310
I saw him do this once before
when a girl dumped him.

473
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:42,068
Now, Howl, you're all right.
We'll just dye your hair back again.

474
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,945
Okay? Oh!

475
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,748
Fine! So, you think you've got it bad?

476
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,460
I've never once been beautiful
in my entire life!

477
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,089
I've had enough of this place!

478
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,881
Thank you, Turnip-head.
How did you get to be so kind?

479
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,176
Sophie, get back inside,
we need your help! Howl's in trouble!

480
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,470
Howl, cut it out! I'm gonna drown!

481
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,057
I'm drowning here, Howl. Sophie!
Sophie, help him, please!

482
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,726
Sophie! Do something!

483
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,064
- Such drama.
- Is he dead?

484
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,984
No, he's fine.
He's just throwing a tantrum.

485
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,028
- Come on. Give me a hand.
- Okay.

486
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,118
- Get the hot water running.
- Right.

487
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,912
Come on, Howl, you can still walk.

488
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,385
- Get him cleaned up, Markl.
- I will.

489
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,930
Now I have to mop again.

490
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,650
This says they've landed
on the coast already.

491
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,776
- Where?
- North.

492
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,040
Howl, I'm coming in.

493
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,008
I brought you some warm milk.
Want a sip?

494
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,932
I'll leave it here for you, then.
Try to drink it before it gets cold.

495
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,437
Sophie, wait.

496
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,239
Do you want some milk?

497
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,293
The Witch of the Waste
is trying to find my castle.

498
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,965
I saw her henchmen at the harbor.

499
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,759
I am such a big coward, all I do is hide.

500
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,763
And all of this magic
is just to keep everybody away.

501
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,723
I can't stand how scared I am.

502
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,812
Howl, why is the Witch of the Waste
trying to hunt you down?

503
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,899
She was once quite beautiful,
so I decided to pursue her.

504
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:13,153
Then I realized she wasn't.
So, as usual, I ran away.

505
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,118
I can't run much longer, though.
I have to report to the palace,

506
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,745
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

507
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,123
How many aliases
do you have, anyway?

508
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,668
- As many as I need to keep my freedom.
- Hmm.

509
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,172
- Just refuse the king's invitation.
- See that?

510
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,509
That's the oath I took when
I entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

511
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,721
I must report to the palace
whenever summoned.

512
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,724
You know, Howl,
I think that you should see the king.

513
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,809
What?

514
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,646
Give him a piece of your mind.
Tell him this war is pointless.

515
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,565
And you refuse to take part, huh?

516
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,445
You obviously don't know
what these people are like.

517
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,572
But he's our king.

518
00:51:56,697 --> 00:52:00,534
He should want to hear
what all his citizens have to say.

519
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,496
I got it!
Why don't you go to the palace for me?

520
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,873
Huh?

521
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,667
Just say
that you're Pendragon's mother,

522
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,711
and your son is such a cowardly wizard,

523
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,421
he's too afraid to show his face.

524
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,466
Maybe then Madame Suliman
will finally give up on me.

525
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,926
Who's Madame Suliman?

526
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,640
You're wearing that hat?

527
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,142
After all the magic I used
to make your dress pretty?

528
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,354
- Take care of him, Markl.
- Mmm-hmm.

529
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,230
Good luck.

530
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,658
This charm will
guarantee your safe return.

531
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,579
Don't worry.
I'll follow behind you in disguise.

532
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,331
Now. Off you go.

533
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,300
Why do I feel like
this is not going to work?

534
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,811
I wonder what Howl
disguised himself as.

535
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,354
Surely not a crow.

536
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,613
Can't be a pigeon,
he's too flamboyant for that.

537
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,204
That could be him.

538
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,802
Look how far I still have to go.

539
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,605
Come on! Step right up!

540
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,430
Howl? You disguised yourself
as an old dog?

541
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,230
You couldn't think
of something a bit more useful?

542
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,608
Do you know how hard it is
to do things when you're old?

543
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,031
Look who's here.
The tacky little girl from the hat shop.

544
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,866
The Witch of the Waste.

545
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,119
Thank you for handing
my scorching love note to Howl.

546
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,582
How's he doing, by the way?

547
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,375
He's acting like a big baby.

548
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,879
And he's working me to the bone
as his cleaning lady.

549
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,340
How delightful.

550
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:06,303
So, tell me, what business
do you have here at the palace?

551
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,306
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

552
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,016
And what about yourself?

553
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:14,019
I received a royal invitation.

554
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:18,941
That idiot Suliman finally realized
how much she needs my powers.

555
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,317
If you're so great,

556
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,653
why don't you break the spell
you put on me?

557
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,238
I'm sorry, dear.

558
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:28,617
My talent lies in casting spells,
not breaking them.

559
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,828
Bye, Granny.

560
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,874
Now, just wait a minute!
You get back here right now!

561
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,961
If I didn't have you to worry about,
I would have clobbered her.

562
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,188
What on earth is wrong with you two?

563
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,606
Sorry, ma'am.

564
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,900
Vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

565
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,735
You must continue on foot.

566
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,237
That Suliman.

567
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,783
Using her magic to force me
to climb all those godforsaken stairs.

568
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:24,965
Come on, Howl.
We can do this, just act natural.

569
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,184
Oh!

570
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,283
Howl, why are you so heavy?

571
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:05,172
Wait. Help. I can't make it.

572
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,507
What'd you say?

573
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,136
You suddenly remembered how
to break the spell you put on me?

574
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,974
I told you. I don't know how.

575
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,518
Then start studying.

576
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,108
I don't get it.

577
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,695
Where does she get all that energy?

578
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,246
I have to rest a bit.

579
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:49,007
Why don't you just give up?
You're killing yourself.

580
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:54,429
I've waited for 50 years now
to be invited here.

581
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:59,267
Ever since that Suliman
banished me to live in the Wastes.

582
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,936
Well, good luck, then.

583
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,856
Too bad I'm not younger,
or I'd lend you a hand.

584
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,942
Come on, Howl.

585
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:12,614
You cold-hearted old hag.
Next time, I'll turn you senile, too.

586
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,096
Almost there!

587
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,057
Honored guest, please follow me.

588
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,685
You should go help her
get up these stairs.

589
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:45,063
I am strictly forbidden
to offer such assistance.

590
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,525
That's so rude.
The king himself invited her.

591
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,111
Come on! Let's go!

592
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,532
Don't give up now!
Are you a witch or aren't you?

593
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,745
Just shut up.

594
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,332
What happened?
You look so much older.

595
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,087
Mrs. Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

596
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,384
Pull yourself together.
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

597
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,557
Mrs. Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

598
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,561
Your name's Pendragon?
Why does that name sound so familiar?

599
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,272
Uh, because that was
the name of my tacky hat shop,

600
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,983
-don't you remember?
- Is that what it was?

601
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,986
Wait in here, please.

602
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,662
A chair! It's mine!

603
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,510
Howl, get back here.

604
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,391
Oh!

605
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,477
This way please, ma'am.

606
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,820
Huh?

607
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,268
Thank you, Madame Suliman.

608
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,603
Madame Suliman.

609
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,914
So, you are Howl's mother, are you?

610
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,001
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

611
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,920
You must be tired. Please have a seat.

612
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,797
Thank you.

613
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,935
I am Madame Suliman,
His Majesty's head sorceress.

614
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,770
Hmm.

615
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,484
That's not your dog, is it?

616
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:42,324
His name is Heen. He's my errand dog.
I had him escort you here.

617
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,327
Oh.

618
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,830
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

619
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,210
He's such a lazy son,
he sent me instead.

620
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:56,338
I'm afraid the king would
find him completely useless.

621
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,217
I am very sorry to hear that.

622
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,054
Howl was the last apprentice
I ever took on.

623
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,641
I'd never seen such a gifted student.

624
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,310
I was so thrilled
to have finally found someone

625
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,896
talented enough to replace me.

626
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,816
Then, one day,
his heart was stolen by a demon.

627
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,194
He never returned
to complete his apprenticeship.

628
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,278
And from that day forward,

629
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:24,157
he has been using his magic
for entirely selfish reasons.

630
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,661
- Mrs. Pendragon.
- Yes?

631
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,746
That boy is extremely dangerous.

632
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,666
His powers are far too great
for someone without a heart.

633
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,544
If he stays selfish,

634
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,506
I'm afraid he'll end up
just like the Witch of the Waste.

635
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,924
Send her in.

636
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,640
What on earth happened to you?

637
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,645
I just restored her
to the age she actually is.

638
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,563
All her powers are gone now.

639
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,943
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

640
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,280
But then she fell prey
to a demon of greed,

641
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,449
who slowly consumed her,
body and soul.

642
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,869
Our kingdom can no longer
afford to turn a blind eye

643
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,330
to these disreputable
witches and wizards.

644
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,915
If Howl reports to me

645
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,459
and vows to use his magic
to serve the kingdom,

646
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,337
I will show him
how to break from his demon.

647
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:23,466
If not, I'll strip him of all his powers.
Just like her.

648
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,511
That is enough!

649
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:30,974
Now I understand why Howl was
so concerned about coming to see you.

650
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,267
It's a trap.

651
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,478
You lure people here
with an invitation from the king,

652
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,273
and then you strip them
of all their powers.

653
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,567
Howl would never be so heartless.

654
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,652
He may be selfish and cowardly,

655
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,863
and sometimes
he's hard to understand,

656
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,325
but his intentions are good.
He just wants to be free.

657
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,453
Howl won't come here.
He doesn't need your help.

658
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,122
He can fix his problem
with his demon on his own.

659
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,291
I am certain of it.

660
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,753
Now I understand.
You're in love with Howl.

661
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,465
Howl? Did you say Howl's coming?

662
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,593
I want his heart,
his heart belongs to me!

663
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,845
Stop that, just calm down.

664
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,431
Howl is not coming here, okay?

665
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,309
Oh, I think he will.

666
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,438
I now know his weakness,
Mrs. Pendragon.

667
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,113
- Your Majesty.
- As you were.

668
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,990
So, then, how are you feeling?

669
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,241
I'm fine, thank you.

670
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,701
Thought I'd drop by,

671
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,787
rather than sit through
a dull war meeting.

672
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,624
- What an honor.
- Who are your guests?

673
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,085
This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.

674
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,294
Ah.

675
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,716
Thanks for coming.

676
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,053
But I've decided not
to use magic to win this war.

677
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,639
We have tried using
Madame Suliman's magic

678
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,141
to shield our palace
from the enemy's bombs.

679
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,894
But the bombs fall
on civilian homes instead.

680
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,730
That's the problem with magic.
Right, Suliman?

681
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,857
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

682
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,818
Suliman!

683
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,072
I've got a new battle plan.

684
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,658
This time we're going
to beat them to a pulp.

685
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,369
Um...

686
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,080
Suliman, that's the best double
you've made of me yet.

687
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,915
Ha! Keep up the good work.

688
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,083
Your Majesty.

689
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,002
- Get my generals assembled.
- Sir.

690
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,342
So nice to see you again, Howl.

691
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,469
You're looking well, Madame Suliman.

692
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,972
Rather weak disguise.
Didn't I teach you better?

693
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,849
I'm not trying to outwit you.

694
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,685
I kept my oath,
I reported when summoned.

695
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,395
Now Mother and I will go.

696
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,397
I'm afraid not.

697
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,962
Whatever you do, don't look down.

698
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,675
It's time to show your mother
what you really are, Howl.

699
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,595
Oh!

700
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:07,106
Stop, Howl, it's a trap!

701
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,412
Hold on.

702
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,297
Sophie, sit up here.

703
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,093
Did you have to bring
those two with you?

704
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,763
Nice doggie.

705
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,809
Hmm. I can't believe
you work for Suliman.

706
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,311
I guess it's too late to toss him.

707
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,480
- Sophie. Take the wheel.
- What?

708
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,984
- I can't fly, are you kidding?
- They're gaining on us.

709
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,409
I'll distract them, then you can
fly back to my castle in the Wastes.

710
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,160
How? I don't know the way.

711
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:04,163
Hey, don't worry. The ring that
I gave you will guide you back home.

712
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,874
All you have to do
is summon Calcifer with your heart.

713
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,793
Calcifer?

714
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,007
It's glowing.

715
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,135
Just keep following that light
and you should be there before dark.

716
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,847
I can't. Why did you make me
come here if you were coming yourself?

717
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,224
Knowing you'd be there
gave me the courage to show up.

718
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,060
That woman terrifies me,
I can't face her on my own.

719
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:31,274
You saved me, Sophie.
I was in big trouble back there.

720
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,485
Oh! Don't let go!

721
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,411
- Wow. You're good.
- Are you nuts?

722
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,664
We've got a good lead now.

723
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,792
I can give you five minutes
of invisibility, so use it wisely.

724
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,674
- Howl!
- Good luck!

725
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,384
Oh!

726
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,479
No, not now.

727
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,899
Oh, thank you.
That was the most fun I've had in ages.

728
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,985
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

729
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,280
Hmm. I bet his mother
can help me find him.

730
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,548
Go!

731
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,052
Huh?

732
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,376
Almost there.
That's my hometown below us.

733
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,340
Don't try to be cute, dog.
I'm still not going to trust you.

734
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,324
The castle is coming to meet us!

735
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,373
Sophie! Here!

736
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:56,377
Markl, help me!
How am I supposed to land this thing?

737
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,850
Sophie!

738
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,102
Nice doggie.

739
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,730
Markl!

740
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,940
I'm home.

741
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,817
Are you hurt?

742
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,027
<i>Whoa!</i>

743
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,279
-I missed you.
- missed you, too.

744
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,448
Thanks for coming to meet us.

745
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,397
Oh, this is bad.
You've gone too far, Howl.

746
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,710
I wonder if Howl's back home.

747
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,975
Howl?

748
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,080
Howl, is that you?

749
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,460
Are you in pain?
Tell me what's happening.

750
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,421
Go away.

751
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,340
No, I'm not going away.

752
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,759
I'm going to help you break
the spell that you're under.

753
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,347
You... You can't
even break your own spell.

754
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:41,477
- But you don't understand. I love you.
- You're too late.

755
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,233
Howl! No!

756
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,247
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

757
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,040
Yeah, and he looks terrible.

758
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,751
You better figure out how
to break the spell on us quick.

759
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,421
Howl's running out of time,
I hope you realize that.

760
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,048
You mean he'll become a monster.
Is that it?

761
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:15,052
I can't tell you details of the curse, lady.
You should know that by now.

762
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,098
Do you know
what Madame Suliman said?

763
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,226
She said that Howl's heart
was stolen by a demon.

764
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,020
Tell me now. What do you know?

765
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,314
I'm so sorry, but that would
be confidential information.

766
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:30,067
What if I dump a bucket
of water on you?

767
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,737
If you drown me, then Howl will die, too!

768
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,968
Hi, Turnip-head.
This isn't gonna be easy.

769
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,557
Okay. Ready!

770
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,227
Calcifer, open it wider.

771
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,189
Here we go!

772
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,871
I said move!

773
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,164
Ow!

774
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,916
Oh! Oh!

775
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:51,398
If I just hang a little curtain here,
maybe Howl won't notice.

776
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,653
Come on in, it's time to eat.

777
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,828
Here. Want some more?

778
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,456
Don't feed her!
That's the Witch of the Waste!

779
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,125
Oh, she's all right.

780
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,836
She keeps staring at me.
It's freaking me out.

781
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,213
What a pretty fire.

782
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,135
- Howl! Hello.
- Good morning, everyone.

783
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,344
Glad you're home.

784
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,513
Master Howl,
we can keep this dog, can't we?

785
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,808
The Witch of the Waste
and Suliman's dog at my table.

786
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,519
What possessed you
to let them in the house, Calcifer?

787
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,104
I didn't let them in.

788
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,731
Sophie crash-landed her plane
into my face.

789
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,570
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

790
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,198
Looks like we have yet
another addition to the family.

791
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:45,035
Hmm, you've got quite
a nasty spell on you, too.

792
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,997
It seems everyone in this family's
got problems.

793
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,416
What a handsome man.

794
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:54,003
So, we've got a lot of work to do.
We're moving.

795
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,921
- Moving?
- That's good.

796
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,591
I'm sick of being stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

797
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:02,428
Madame Suliman is hot on our trail,
so we're gonna have to hurry.

798
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,181
I'm afraid your spell
is too strong for this move.

799
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,765
You're gonna have to stay behind.

800
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,565
There. All done.

801
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,485
All right, Calcifer, line her up.

802
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,628
There. That should do it.
Sit tight for a second.

803
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,300
Be gentle with me, please.

804
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,638
On my mark.

805
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,893
Moving's done. You can get down now.

806
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,398
This is great, Master Howl! It's huge!

807
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,818
Oh, what a pretty fire.

808
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,501
- But this is...
- I added on a bathroom,

809
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,379
since our family seems to keep growing.

810
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,631
Come over here, Sophie.

811
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,512
I added another bedroom, too.

812
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:09,722
Have a look.

813
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,313
Oh.

814
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,692
Why'd you do this?

815
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,070
So we'd have a room that suited you.
Do you like it?

816
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:30,034
Of course.
It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

817
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:33,120
I got you some new clothes, too.
But you can open them later.

818
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,248
Come on, Sophie. Look at this.

819
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:41,211
- All right, a courtyard!
- That shop's ours, too.

820
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,005
Heen! Come on!

821
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:47,885
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new portal.

822
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,806
It's a present for you. Come see.

823
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,025
Oh!

824
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,459
You like it? It's my secret garden.

825
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,628
It's incredible.

826
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:27,091
Did you use your magic to make this?

827
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:30,302
Only a little,
just to help the flowers grow.

828
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,313
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

829
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,315
It's like a dream.

830
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,507
Sophie?

831
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:13,053
It all seems so familiar,
yet I know I've never been here before.

832
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,472
I feel so at home.

833
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,016
- Come with me.
- Okay.

834
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,693
Look there.

835
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,240
What a cute cottage.

836
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,492
That was my secret hideaway.

837
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,745
I spent a lot of time here
by myself when I was young.

838
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,708
You were alone?

839
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:47,296
My uncle, who was a wizard,
gave me this place as my private study.

840
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,299
Now you can come here
whenever you like.

841
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,053
What's the matter?

842
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,306
It's... You're scaring me.

843
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,558
I have this weird feeling
that you're going to leave.

844
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:07,608
Howl, tell me what's going on. Please.
I don't care if you're a monster.

845
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,825
I'm setting things up so that
all of you can live comfortably.

846
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,869
With all the flowers
you've got in this valley,

847
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,371
you could easily open up a flower shop.

848
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,374
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

849
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,710
So, you are going away?

850
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:31,173
Please, Howl,
I know I can be of help to you.

851
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:35,469
Even though I'm not pretty,
and all I'm good at is cleaning.

852
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,639
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

853
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:46,188
Well, the nice thing about being old
is you've got nothing much to lose.

854
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:49,983
Hmm?

855
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,579
- What is that thing doing out here?
- A battleship?

856
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,289
Still looking for more cities to burn.

857
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,542
Is it the enemy's or one of ours?

858
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,293
What difference does it make?

859
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,474
Those stupid murderers.

860
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,276
We can't just let them
fly off with all those bombs.

861
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,086
What's happening? What did you do?

862
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,797
Just messed with it.
It won't crash, though.

863
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,383
Oh!

864
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:58,510
Howl!

865
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,013
Uh-oh. Here they come.

866
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:13,734
Those things are Suliman's henchmen.
Let's go.

867
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,945
Faster! We need to take off!

868
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,376
All right, you're going in.

869
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,920
No! Don't let go!

870
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,514
Sophie, what happened?

871
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,225
Oh! I'm too old to be treated like this!

872
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:00,572
- Uh, good night, Sophie.
- Good night, Markl.

873
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,826
Oh, don't worry
about Master Howl, Sophie.

874
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,079
Sometimes he likes
to go away for days on end.

875
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,581
Thank you. That's good to know.

876
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,292
- Need anything else?
- No, I'm fine.

877
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,503
Well. Good night, then.

878
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,754
You're in love.

879
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:22,010
Don't deny it.
You've been sighing all day.

880
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,440
Hmm. Just as I thought.

881
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:38,068
Have you ever been in love before?

882
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:41,238
Of course I have. I'm still in love.

883
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,701
Strapping, young men
are so difficult to deal with.

884
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,370
But their hearts, I just adore.

885
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,205
You're terrible.

886
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,916
And they're so cute, too.

887
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,879
What's that?

888
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,506
It's an air raid siren.

889
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:01,633
Air raid?

890
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,386
It's a long way's off.

891
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,972
But you better not
go outside tonight, dear.

892
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:12,477
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen
are looking everywhere for this place.

893
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,816
What a good fire.

894
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,026
He keeps this house so well hidden.

895
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,731
- Sophie, there's a strange lady here!
- Hmm?

896
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,364
Mother?

897
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,533
Sophie!

898
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,039
Thank goodness you're here!
I searched everywhere for you!

899
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,292
Oh, my, look at your face, you're so old!

900
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,128
Everyone's saying
it's my fault that you left!

901
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,758
You'll forgive me,
oh, won't you? Oh, Sophie!

902
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,134
Mother.

903
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,389
I barely recognize the place.

904
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:34,851
Who is that woman?
Huh? The landlady?

905
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,271
Oh! I forgot to tell you!
I got married again!

906
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,149
He's such a nice man,
and he's filthy rich, too,

907
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,193
so we can all live together again!

908
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:45,904
You won't have
to work as a cleaning lady.

909
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:49,741
That's all right, Mother.
I actually like living here.

910
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,410
Really? I forgot!

911
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,413
I've got a car waiting. I've gotta run.

912
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,375
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

913
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:17,227
A peeping bug?
Can't Suliman do better than that?

914
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,020
Open wide, Cal.

915
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,740
I hope you and your new husband
will be very happy.

916
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:34,786
- Thank you, Sophie. Bye.
- Bye, Mother.

917
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,542
I did what I was told.
Now take me to my husband.

918
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,962
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure
Madame Suliman will be very pleased.

919
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,924
Forgive me, Sophie.

920
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,305
Wow. Look at all of them.

921
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,309
If they keep leaving at this rate,
the town will soon be empty.

922
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,312
- Do you want to leave, too, Sophie?
- What?

923
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,898
That lady said she wants you
to live with her now.

924
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:06,651
Yes, well, at least
she cared enough to visit.

925
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,154
Don't leave, Sophie.

926
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,282
I love you. You have to stay.

927
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:17,662
On, I love you, too, Markl. I'll stay.

928
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,664
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

929
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,458
Because we're a family now.

930
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,418
Yes, we're a family.

931
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,670
Thank you, Sophie.

932
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,264
I'll never let Suliman get a hold of Howl.

933
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:55,325
But the newspaper says we won.

934
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:59,204
Only idiots believe
what they read in the paper.

935
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,041
That's so strange.
I can't get Calcifer going.

936
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:07,379
Do you have to keep smoking that?
It smells terrible.

937
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:10,298
Don't deny an old witch
her pleasures, young lady.

938
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,550
<i>Mark), will you
crack a window, please?</i>

939
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,219
Mmm-hmm.

940
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,974
I wouldn't open that window,
If ll were you, dear.

941
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,603
Calcifer's too weak right now
to protect this place.

942
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:25,563
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

943
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:28,692
<i>Mark!!</i>

944
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,204
Get back!

945
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:49,129
Markl, get back inside.
I'm going to check on the shop.

946
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:50,213
Mmm-hmm.

947
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,649
There are bombs falling on us!

948
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:13,403
Why can't you put out
some fires instead?

949
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,054
Howl! No!

950
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:42,849
Oh!

951
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:52,984
This is exciting.

952
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,999
Howl!

953
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,795
I'm sorry, Sophie.
I should've gotten here sooner.

954
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:15,465
You're alive! Oh, thank goodness!

955
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,484
Master Howl!! Sophie! You're okay!

956
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,365
Calcifer. You hang in there, now.

957
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:49,249
Tell me, was that cigar a gift
from Madame Suliman by any chance?

958
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,585
Howl, she fed me something gross.
I feel sick.

959
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,547
Why, if it isn't Howl.

960
01:33:55,839 --> 01:34:00,051
I think you and I need to have
a nice, long, heart-to-heart chat.

961
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:05,014
There's nothing I'd like more than that,
but right now there's a war going on.

962
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:09,018
How unlike you, Howl,
not running away anymore.

963
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,187
Until later, then.

964
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,649
Stay here. Calcifer will protect you
from the henchmen.

965
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,526
I'll stand guard out front.

966
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:22,490
No, wait! Howl! Don't go out there.
It's too dangerous.

967
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,325
Another wave's coming.

968
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,286
And Calcifer's too weak
to stop the bombs.

969
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,746
Let's run! Don't fight them, Howl.

970
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,708
Sorry. I've had enough
of running away, Sophie.

971
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:36,588
Now I've got something
I want to protect. It's you.

972
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:43,094
Come back!

973
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:58,943
Hmm!

974
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,513
There's where we are, at the shop.

975
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,352
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

976
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:24,862
Howl, look out!

977
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:36,708
What's going on? Turnip!

978
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,505
- Markl, I need your help.
- Huh?

979
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:45,466
Are you crazy? I can't move
the portals without Howl's help.

980
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:49,012
Try. If we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting the hat shop.

981
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,014
I'd preferred him as a coward.

982
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:54,392
- Okay, we have to go now.
- Are we going for a stroll?

983
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,769
We can't do that.
It'll make us too vulnerable!

984
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,146
We already are.

985
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,565
If we don't move quick,
Howl doesn't have a chance.

986
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:03,276
Sophie! They're about
to bomb the hat shop!

987
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:05,528
Quick. Help her get outside, okay?

988
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:07,196
Right.

989
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,408
You're coming with us. Hop on.

990
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,160
I can't! It's impossible!

991
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,370
No one but Howl
can take me out of this hearth.

992
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,415
There's no time to lose.
We have to try something.

993
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,334
Oh! Don't do this! No, no!

994
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,753
Help, help, crazy lady with a shovel!

995
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,922
If you take me out that door,
the castle could collapse.

996
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,090
Good!

997
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,346
- We're ready.
- Okay, step back.

998
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,890
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

999
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:37,769
I don't know what'll happen,
but I'm sure it won't be good.

1000
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:10,343
I told you it would collapse.
Rain! Rain!

1001
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,347
That ship's headed for town!

1002
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,973
Markl, look after her, okay?

1003
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:18,101
Turnip-head,
help me find a way back in.

1004
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:21,479
Don't you worry, now, ma'am,
I'll take good care of you.

1005
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,484
Markl, here's a way in!

1006
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,414
The roof's leaking.
Don't let me get wet!

1007
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:40,665
Hold on for a second.

1008
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,209
It's wet here, Sophie! Ah!

1009
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:47,422
Too damp, too damp, very damp here!

1010
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:48,798
Hurry! Hurry!

1011
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,675
Hurry, please!

1012
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:59,517
<i>Mark), hurry, get inside.</i>

1013
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,519
The castle's a wreck.

1014
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:05,273
Told you we should have stayed put.
Howl and I could have handled it.

1015
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,445
We have to tell Howl
we're not attached to the hat shop now.

1016
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:12,780
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

1017
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,532
Ah! What?

1018
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,536
I know you can do it.
I've never seen a fire with more spark.

1019
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,623
But there's no chimney here,
and I keep getting dripped on.

1020
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,125
And the wood's all damp.

1021
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:28,921
They say that the best blaze brightest
when circumstances are at their worst.

1022
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:31,549
Yeah, but no one really believes that.

1023
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,800
Come on, let's be honest.

1024
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:36,471
- Oh! What a pretty fire.
- Why don't you have a seat.

1025
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,557
All right.
I need something of yours, Sophie.

1026
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:40,808
Why's that?

1027
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,478
I can't do it by myself.
How about your eyes?

1028
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:46,564
Huh? How about this?

1029
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,296
Ah!

1030
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,823
Ah!

1031
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:54,465
Thanks, Calcifer. You're fantastic!

1032
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:57,802
Imagine what I could've done
with your eyes. Or your heart.

1033
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,930
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

1034
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,309
I found it!

1035
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:20,241
I can see Howl down there.
Looks like he's trapped!

1036
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,707
Calcifer, hurry!

1037
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,377
- No!
- Put it back!

1038
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,838
Let go!

1039
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,465
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1040
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:49,103
Put it back now!

1041
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,773
It's hot! Ah!

1042
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,942
- It's burning me!
- Let go!

1043
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,028
You're catching on fire!

1044
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:04,327
No, it's mine. It's mine! It's mine!

1045
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,004
Ah!

1046
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,675
Sophie!

1047
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:26,098
- Sophie!
- Sophie ruined it!

1048
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:28,225
My heart's ruined!

1049
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:15,815
Heen, what have I done?
I poured water on Calcifer!

1050
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,903
What if I killed Howl, too?

1051
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:50,141
It's moving. Is Howl still alive?

1052
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,601
Can you lead me to him?

1053
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,083
The front door.

1054
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,704
Heen.

1055
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,199
That's Howl.

1056
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,970
I know where I am.
I'm in Howl's childhood.

1057
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:58,078
Oh!

1058
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,093
Howl! Calcifer!

1059
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:57,179
It's me, Sophie!

1060
01:47:57,262 --> 01:47:59,890
I know how to help you now.

1061
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:03,727
Find me in the future!

1062
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:38,595
Sorry, Heen. I'm trying to hurry.

1063
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:41,098
I just can't seem to stop crying.

1064
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:06,749
Howl.

1065
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:15,799
I'm sorry. Did I come too late?

1066
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,761
I didn't mean to make you wait this long.

1067
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:25,768
I need you to take me to Calcifer
if you can.

1068
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,708
- He's dead?
- No, Markl.

1069
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:37,506
Howl needs that back now.

1070
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:41,385
Don't look at me. I don't have it.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1071
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:42,678
Please.

1072
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:46,807
Please give it back.

1073
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:51,854
You really want it that badly?

1074
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:54,148
Yes.

1075
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,566
All right, then.

1076
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:58,527
- You'd better take good care of it.
- Okay.

1077
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,612
Here, dear.

1078
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:04,074
Thank you, you have a big heart.

1079
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,883
Calcifer.

1080
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,720
Sophie, I'm so tired.

1081
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:28,390
If I give Howl back his heart,
what will happen to you?

1082
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:31,101
I'll be okay if you do it. I think.

1083
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:35,856
You dumped water on me,
and Howl and I both survived.

1084
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:38,192
I better try then.

1085
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:44,031
It's so warm and fluttering like a bird.

1086
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,617
It's still just the heart of a child.

1087
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:50,537
Please, help Calicifer live.

1088
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:53,916
And please help Howl
take back his heart.

1089
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:08,764
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Look, I'm free!

1090
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:13,101
Free! Free! I'm alive!

1091
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:16,688
He moved! See?

1092
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,070
It can't stand without Calcifer!

1093
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,002
Turnip!

1094
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:53,267
His pole snapped!

1095
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,435
Are you all right?
We'll get you a new pole, okay?

1096
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,857
You saved us, Turnip.

1097
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,616
Thank you, Sophie.

1098
01:53:10,409 --> 01:53:12,995
I'm the prince missing
from the neighboring kingdom.

1099
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:15,205
Somehow I got that blasted spell on me.

1100
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:19,001
I know that spell.
A kiss from your true love breaks it.

1101
01:53:19,084 --> 01:53:21,295
That's right. If it weren't for Sophie,

1102
01:53:21,378 --> 01:53:23,547
I would have been a scarecrow
for the rest of my life.

1103
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:26,091
My, what a
strapping young man you are.

1104
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:28,593
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

1105
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,222
I feel terrible,
like there's a weight on my chest.

1106
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,058
A heart's a heavy burden.

1107
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:39,062
Wow! Sophie,
your hair looks just like starlight.

1108
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:40,522
It's beautiful.

1109
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:43,233
You think so? So do I!

1110
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,779
It looks like your true love
is in love with someone else.

1111
01:53:47,863 --> 01:53:51,533
You should go home anyway,
and tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1112
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:53,243
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1113
01:53:53,618 --> 01:53:56,830
One thing you can always count on
is that hearts change.

1114
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:59,541
So as soon as this war is over,
I shall return.

1115
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,294
I love it when you talk like that.

1116
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:04,921
I'll look forward to your return, big boy.

1117
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:15,557
There you are.
You should have checked in earlier.

1118
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,601
What on earth were you up to?

1119
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:23,065
Howl found his true love.

1120
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:25,359
You little traitor.

1121
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:33,950
The game is over.

1122
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:37,996
Get me the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defense.

1123
01:54:38,163 --> 01:54:39,539
It's time to put an end

1124
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,625
-to this idiotic war.
- Yes, ma'am.

1125
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,628
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1126
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:47,255
You didn't have to come back, Calcifer.

1127
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,136
I Kind of missed you guys.
And it looks like it's gonna rain.

1128
01:54:53,261 --> 01:54:56,223
I missed you, too, Calcifer.

1129
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:57,974
Wow!
