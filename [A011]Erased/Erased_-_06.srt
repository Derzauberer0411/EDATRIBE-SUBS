1
00:00:01,197 --> 00:00:05,670
I think my dad left because he couldn't bear
everyone in town thinking he was a thief.

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:11,331
And Mom, I bet her not believing him either
was really what bothered him the most.

3
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:14,786
The whole thing made me want
to stop trusting people.

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:17,354
I felt like I was being forced
to choose sides.

5
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,216
I thought, if I hated my mom or my
dad, maybe I'd feel better.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,045
Then a few years later,
I heard my mom say,

7
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,198
"Why couldn't I just believe him?"

8
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,492
Then I knew she was miserable too.

9
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:31,864
And then,
when I heard her say that,

10
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:35,226
I decided to keep on trusting
and loving them both.

11
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:40,152
I realized that if there's
one thing I'm really good at,

12
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,146
it's believing in people.

13
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,696
<i>Wha...</i>
<i>What the hell?</i>

14
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:19,132
I just saw Airi
go inside.

15
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:22,569
Then she might be stuck
and can't get out. Hey!

16
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,507
Airi!

17
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:30,410
Airi, can you hear me?!

18
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,645
Airi!

19
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:41,986
Airi! We gotta go.

20
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,899
<i>She's heavy.</i>

21
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,515
Hang on, I'll get you
out of here.

22
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:06,274
<i>Crap!
I can't lug her down by myself.</i>

23
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:12,285
‐What are you doing? 
‐You manga guys really should hit the gym more often.

24
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:15,022
Let's hurry before we get barbecued.

25
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:23,363
Get going out the back.

26
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:25,032
I got her from here.

27
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,167
Don't get her mixed up in your shit.

28
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,009
Guess I get to be the hero today.

29
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,839
<i>I hope Airi's OK.</i>

30
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:49,531
<i>How did that fire start?</i>

31
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,870
<i>Was it an accident or..</i>
<i>the killer?</i>

32
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:54,593
<i>Wait.</i>

33
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,267
<i>He</i> was <i>trying to kill Airi with that fire.</i>

34
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>And he was trying to frame me for it.</i>

35
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:07,082
<i>That's why she gave me her phone,
so the cops wouldn't find the email.</i>

36
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,017
<i>He knew where she lived.</i>
<i>Maybe he followed her or...</i>

37
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,014
<i>maybe she knows him.</i>

38
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:17,451
<i>Whoever he is, he's close.</i>

39
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,502
<i>I'm gonna find him.</i>

40
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,998
<i>And with any luck,
I'll get to him before the cops catch me.</i>

41
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,927
<i>This stop Koiwa.</i>

42
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:28,896
<i>Make sure you have</i>
<i>your belongings before...</i>

43
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:37,270
Hello? Hello?

44
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,204
All right, who is this?

45
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,741
<i>Satoru Fujinuma.</i>

46
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,513
If you're who you say you are, 
then nice to meet ya.

47
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:49,082
I've been expecting your call.

48
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,285
Sure, I'd be glad to.
But not here.

49
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:54,654
Someplace public.

50
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:58,258
No, I'm not telling you
who I am just yet.

51
00:04:58,258 --> 00:04:59,993
Tomorrow, when we meet.

52
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,548
'Cause if you're not who you say you are,

53
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:05,168
then you're the son of a bitch that killed Sachiko.

54
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,049
‐
‐ Sit down anywhere.

55
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,497
Oh, hey, Satoru. Over here.

56
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:15,919
I'm Sawada.

57
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:18,779
I used to work with your mom at Ishikari TV.

58
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:21,573
Goddamn, you look just like Sachiko.

59
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,108
Yeah, you're her kid,
no doubt about it.

60
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,478
<i>It's him.</i>

61
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,410
I bet you're wondering if you can trust me.

62
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,237
But there's nothing to worry about.

63
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:35,032
I didn't tell the cops you called
and I didn't kill your mom.

64
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,487
Yeah, well, maybe you think
I killed her.

65
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,823
‐ Not even.
‐How can you be sure?

66
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,203
'Cause I knew your mom

67
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,231
and I know she didn't raise
the kind of son who'd kill her.

68
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,598
Hmm, I see.

69
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,801
Yeah, I remembered
I had it in my pocket yesterday.

70
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,857
You're in it deep,
that's for sure.

71
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,850
Tell me about it.

72
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,017
And now I'm on the run
'cause I panicked.

73
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,977
I can't stop screwing things up.

74
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:04,418
What happened happened,
so it's pointless to beat yourself up about it.

75
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:08,137
That's something your mom liked to say.

76
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:10,131
It's kind of appropriate, don't you think?

77
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,359
You want me to tell you what we
talked about the other day?

78
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:17,837
Yeah.

79
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,157
Do you remember 18 years ago,

80
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,760
when that serial killer was targeting kids?

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,562
Yeah, sure. 
Jun Shiratori's still sitting on death row

82
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,330
and still denying he killed them.

83
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,533
<i>Well, Satoru was right about him.</i>

84
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:36,595
<i>Shiratori's innocent, 
and I think I've figured out who the real killer is.</i>

85
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>Can you meet me at Koiwa station tomorrow?</i>

86
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,816
I should have asked for the guy's name.

87
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,886
Anyway, let's talk about
what happened back then.

88
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,472
- ‐About how Kayo Hinazuki died.
- ‐

89
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,399
We know that on the night of March the 2nd,

90
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:58,961
Kayo's mom and her boyfriend beat
her and locked her in the shed.

91
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,417
That was around 10:00, and she was still alive.

92
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,132
We know she froze to death,

93
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,334
and we also know that when the mom and the
boyfriend found her body the next morning,they hid it.

94
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,672
'cause they didn't want to take the fall for the murder.

95
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,608
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

96
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:15,845
The theory goes that Kayo was taken
from the shed sometime after 10 p. m.

97
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:20,292
At about 12:30, Kayo's mom went
out to get her and found her gone.

98
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:24,925
Then she called your house and asked
your mom if she knew where Kayo was.

99
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,180
When they arrested
Jun Shiratori,

100
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:32,273
the only evidence they had that tied him to
the crime was a pair of rubber boots he owned.

101
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,356
The tread matched tracks
they found near the shed.

102
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,374
Here's how the police figured the killing went down.

103
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,209
First he knocked her out and took some pictures of her.

104
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:48,140
Next, he put her in the walk‐in freezer
at work and sprayed her with water.

105
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,835
As soon as her temperature dropped to
20Â°, she was brain‐dead.

106
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,427
He waited around for about 30
minutes to make sure she was gone.

107
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:01,018
Then, just before dawn,
he put her body back in the shed.

108
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,269
There's no way Yuuki killed her.

109
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,426
Kayo Hinazuki, 
Hiromi Sugita and Aya Nakanishi...

110
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,532
Just before those three went missing,

111
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,909
the same exact thing happened in
the next town over from yours.

112
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:23,282
Someone was quickly arrested,
but he swore he was innocent, same as Shiratori.

113
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:27,152
You see?
Same crime, same pattern.

114
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,146
It's beyond coincidental.

115
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,422
- ‐That means...
- ‐ Exactly.

116
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,784
I've been trying to tell people for years.

117
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,525
They called me crazy, 
but in the end, I was right.

118
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,163
These crimes were never really solved.

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,547
The killer framed every suspect.

120
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,003
So whoever murdered Kayo also murdered Sachiko!

121
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,513
He's still on the loose.
In this city.

122
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,873
This bastard's beyond clever.

123
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,759
He plants a false trail of
evidence at the scene of the crime

124
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,668
that leads the cops away from him

125
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,795
and straight toward some other poor sucker.

126
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,318
And while everyone looks the other way,
 he kills again.

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,482
<i>This is too much.</i>

128
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:21,151
You think he'll try it again?

129
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,487
If Fujinuma shows his face here,

130
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,322
I'm gonna take his ass out personally.

131
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,559
So what's the story
with the high school girl?

132
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,956
She was in it with him.

133
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,192
Yeah, but he didn't
want any loose threads,

134
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,428
so he tried to kill her too to shut her up.

135
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:37,328
Dragging her into this shit.
 What an asshole.

136
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,635
<i>They're wrong.</i>

137
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:42,541
Please, Airi, you don't have
to apologize for anything.

138
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:46,076
Your uncle's right.
 We didn't know there was a stalker after you.

139
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,404
You must have been so terrified.

140
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,269
‐But, Auntie,that's not..
‐You poor thing.

141
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,291
We shouldn't have left you all
alone in the house like that.

142
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,915
‐ You're wrong.
 ‐The police know who it is and they'll catch him soon.

143
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,975
You have nothing to worry about now.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,735
<i>They're all wrong.</i>

145
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:15,738
<i>Everyone thinks Satoru killed
his mom and tried to kill me.</i>

146
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,451
<i>But that's crazy.</i>

147
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:21,682
<i>It doesn't matter what I say,</i>
<i>no one believes me.</i>

148
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,505
You sure the message was sent from Sachiko's phone?

149
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,396
Yeah. 
Before I could get Airi out of the house,

150
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,179
she slipped her phone in my pocket.

151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,916
Check it out.

152
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,357
You weren't kidding.

153
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,577
Looks like he wanted to help the cops catch you 
by pinning the fire on you too.

154
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,189
But why go to all that trouble?

155
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,250
I'm already a suspect in one murder.

156
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:53,271
Uh‐uh. 
This wasn't about framing me.

157
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:55,491
He was after Airi for another reason.

158
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:58,953
Do you think he tried to kill her
 because she had something on him?

159
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:03,466
To get me to take the fall for my mom's murder,
he had to know when I'd be home to find her.

160
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,222
That means he new my schedule.

161
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,688
So in the 24 hours between when my mom
saw him try to kidnap that little girl

162
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:13,234
and when he killed my mom, 
he must have gone to the pizza place

163
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,275
and had a look at the shift schedule.

164
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,635
If that's what happened,
I bet Airi saw his face.

165
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,338
He might even be someone I've seen before.

166
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,425
It's possible.

167
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,826
All we have to do is find out who got behind the
counter that day and we might have our killer.

168
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:31,215
Hell, it's worth a shot.
It might even break this case wide open.

169
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,506
‐I'm off to the hospital.
‐Uh... OK.

170
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:38,098
There's a report on the murders
from 18 years ago on my computer.

171
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,519
You should check it out.

172
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:46,303
<i>I have a theory that Jun Shiratori might
suspect his father to be the killer.</i>

173
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,992
<i>Shiratori's refusal to talk to
authorities did not help his case.</i>

174
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:54,621
<i>Perhaps he did not want to say anything
that could possibly incriminate his father.</i>

175
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,244
<i>That figures.</i>
<i>Yuuki loved his dad.</i>

176
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,605
<i>Kayo Hinazuki's classmates testified they had
seen her and Shiratori together many times.</i>

177
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,826
<i>The investigators focused on their testimonies,</i>

178
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,247
<i>while ignoring Satoru Fujinuma's.</i>

179
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,321
<i>Suspects.</i>

180
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:13,948
<i>I don't know any of them besides Yuuki and his dad.</i>

181
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,160
<i>They only had five?</i>

182
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,582
<i>The investigators thought
Hiromi Sugita was murdered</i>

183
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:22,143
<i>because the killer</i>
<i>mistook him for a girl.</i>

184
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,936
<i>Based on this assumption,
they made a list of five suspects,</i>

185
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,012
<i>none of whom knew Hiromi Sugita.</i>

186
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,698
PE today is folk dancing.

187
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,508
Eww! That sucks ass.

188
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,805
I don't wanna hold some ugly girl's hand.

189
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,872
But I'd be OK holding Hiromi's.

190
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,032
Oh... that's gutsy.

191
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,660
<i>I think I know why Hiromi was murdered.</i>

192
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,055
<i>The killer knew he was a boy.</i>

193
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,674
<i>He only killed him to cover his tracks,</i>

194
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:50,094
<i>to keep his name off the list.</i>

195
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:56,698
<i>Jun Shiratori was arrested after someone in the neighborhood
reported seeing him talking to a third‐grade girl.</i>

196
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,934
<i>The girl was alone at the time.</i>

197
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>In the storage room of Shiratori Foods,</i>

198
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:04,480
<i>police found photos of Hiromi Sugita's body.</i>

199
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:09,778
<i>From these photos, investigators suspected Jun
Shiratori of having pedophiliac tendencies,</i>

200
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:12,939
<i>and magazines popular with
pedophiles were found in his room,</i>

201
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>confirming their suspicions.</i>

202
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,897
<i>He didn't have that shit.</i>

203
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:19,513
<i>The killer planted that stuff
to keep the cops off his trail.</i>

204
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,666
<i>Who were the suspects before Hiromi died?</i>

205
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>Ten to one,
the killer's name's on it.</i>

206
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:29,528
- ‐ ‐ Ms.
-  Katagiri, are you awake?

207
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,879
Excuse me,
I'm visiting someone, but...

208
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,546
- ‐Is the bathroom that way?
- ‐ Yes.

209
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,833
<i>Her name wouldn't be listed.</i>

210
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,653
<i>201 is vacant.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

211
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,284
‐She's sound asleep.
‐Thanks for the update.

212
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,682
Oh, one side!
I gotta pee like a mother.

213
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,515
Ms. Katagiri.

214
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,509
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

215
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,082
You wouldn't happen
to be be Satoru Fujinuma, hmm?

216
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:03,522
Huh? Uh, no.
Actually, I'm a friend of Satoru's.

217
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,940
It's nice to meet you.

218
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,812
I'm Airi's mother.

219
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,271
Satoru didn't do what the police are saying.

220
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:20,143
I know he didn't kill his mom,
and he wasn't trying to kill me either.

221
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,712
He didn't set that fire.
He was the one who saved me from it.

222
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,542
You're confused,
after breathing all that smoke.

223
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,150
Your manager got you out
of the house in time.

224
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:32,237
I don't know what they've told you, 
but none of it's true.

225
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,009
They're even saying I helped him kill his mom.

226
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,944
The worst part about all this is... no one believes me.

227
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:42,813
No one believes Satoru either, and he's all alone now.

228
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,825
Airi, 
even after all these years,

229
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,615
I still think about your father.

230
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,587
I should have gone after him.

231
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,664
I believe you, hon.

232
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,997
Hurry up now.
Go and find Satoru.

233
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:12,844
<i>Oh, crap.</i>
<i>I forgot to turn it off.</i>

234
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:22,156
<i>You left it on!</i>
<i>Thank God.</i>

235
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,525
Airi, are you OK?

236
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,676
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I'm good as new.</i>

237
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:29,822
<i>But I need to see you.
Can you meet me under the you‐know‐what?</i>

238
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,508
Wait, no, don't go there.

239
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:35,671
-I got you in enough trouble..
-Don't worry, I'll make sure no one follows me, promise.

240
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,877
- ‐ And go!
- ‐ Yeah, let's follow it!

241
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,452
<i>Meeting her isn't a good idea.</i>

242
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,983
<i>I could have asked if she saw
someone peeking at the schedule.</i>

243
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,182
<i>The more she gets involved,
the worse it's gonna be for her.</i>

244
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,726
That sucked.

245
00:15:57,297 --> 00:16:00,783
‐It doesn't fly that far at all.
‐Yeah, how come?

246
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,564
The wings are straight.

247
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:07,151
If you do this,
it'll give it more aerodynamic lift.

248
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,071
Are you sure that's really gonna help it?

249
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,154
Try it out.

250
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,410
No way, it worked!

251
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,046
Look, it's heading for the river!

252
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,750
What's a grown‐up doing
here at this time of day?

253
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,452
Is he out of work?
I hope he's not a pervert.

254
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,579
<i>Poor Yuuki. 
I bet he had to hear the same thing back then.</i>

255
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:05,593
- ‐ See? I made it.
- ‐ Yeah.

256
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:08,395
And I made sure no one followed,
like I promised.

257
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,765
Cool.
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

258
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,913
For a sec there, 
I thought this might be a trap by the cops.

259
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,827
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

260
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,948
You better be thinking like that.

261
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,341
You're a fugitive so you can't take any chances.

262
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:25,509
Anyway, 
I'm glad you trusted me enough to meet me.

263
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:26,877
Yeah.

264
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,541
At work...

265
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,519
I'd say Mr. Nishizono is pretty sketchy.

266
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,269
‐Nishizono?
‐I've seen him once or twice.

267
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:37,625
He's on the city council 'cause he wears that pen.

268
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,894
The boss is always kissing his butt, too.

269
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,063
When they meet,
it's always been in the boss's office,

270
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:45,099
so he could totally peek at the
schedule and get my address.

271
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,901
Hah, I even said hi to him.

272
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,904
<i>The list didn't have a Nishizono on it.</i>

273
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,326
<i>Maybe it's a fake name.</i>

274
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:54,609
<i>No, he couldn't use a fake name
if he's on the city council.</i>

275
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,679
I think he came after me 'cause I saw his face before.

276
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,516
<i>That's not coming together.
Goddamn it.</i>

277
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,432
<i>There's still a piece missing.</i>

278
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,387
Satoru, 
I know how you must be feeling,

279
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,747
but you can't beat yourself up.

280
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:11,728
I try and try.
I can never make things right.

281
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,661
‐Hmm?
‐Oh, nothing.

282
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,797
It's an idea for a manga I had.

283
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,565
The Grim Reaper makes a scheduling error

284
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,567
and the kid dies on the wrong day.

285
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,384
He tries to bring the kid back to life, 
but it backfires.

286
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,578
Someone else dies,
so he tries again,

287
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,733
and someone else suffers.

288
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,311
He just wants to do the right thing,but ...

289
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:33,848
everyone he meets ends up one way or the other,

290
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,800
miserable or dead.

291
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,756
So are you saying you're kind of like that Grim Reaper?

292
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,001
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

293
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,228
You're an idiot.
Do I look dead?

294
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,577
And as for being miserable or whatever,
what does he know? That's his opinion.

295
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:53,669
Your Grim Reaper character should
have a little more faith in himself.

296
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:58,773
I think it's too soon to give up on what
you want 'cause nothing's set in stone.

297
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:01,175
However this ends is still up in the air,

298
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,510
and no one knows what it's gonna be yet.

299
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,582
Airi, 
I'm really glad I got to meet you.

300
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,433
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

301
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,256
Satoru Fujinuma.

302
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,841
‐Run, Satoru!
‐Out of the way!

303
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,604
Airi!

304
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,649
Satoru Fujinuma,
you're under arrest

305
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,748
for murder, attempted murder, and arson.

306
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,813
4:50 p. m.,
suspect apprehended.

307
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:45,075
He didn't do it! Let me go! He's innocent!
He didn't kill anyone! Satoru!

308
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:47,722
<i>I knew me and Airi wouldn't last.</i>

309
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:51,125
<i>Either I'd get caught or Revival would make it disappear.</i>

310
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,796
<i>Here it is, 
the last time I'll ever see her.</i>

311
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,863
<i>I know what I should do.</i>

312
00:19:56,888 --> 00:20:01,235
Satoru! I'm sorry!
I didn't tell 'em you were here!

313
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:06,440
I swear I didn't tell 'em!
They followed me! I'm sorry, Satoru!

314
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,852
<i>I have to leave her with some kind of hope.</i>

315
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>Just like she did for me.</i>

316
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

317
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,797
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!

318
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:23,019
<i>What would a superhero say at a time like this?</i>

319
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:30,402
Isn't it hard having to fight bad guys by yourself?

320
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,071
It's not your fault.

321
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,974
I know I'll get through this somehow,

322
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,543
'cause I know you believe in me.

323
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:46,614
So thank you, Airi.
I'm glad I trusted you.
