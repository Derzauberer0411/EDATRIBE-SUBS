1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,227
<i>I have a name for
what happens to me:</i>

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:04,315
<i>Revival.</i>

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:12,786
<i>When it happens, I go back in time
anywhere from one to five minutes.</i>

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:17,007
<i>Then it always happens</i>
<i>before something bad goes down.</i>

5
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,943
<i>I've managed to stop</i>
<i>a lot of tragedies, so far.</i>

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,975
Hey there, Satoru.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,401
Hey, Mom.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,993
Are you Satoru Fujinuma?

9
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,261
You're gonna have to
come down to the station.

10
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:17,498
See Mask Man?
Next week's the last episode!

11
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,011
Ah, I totally forgot
to watch <i>Black!</i>

12
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,507
<i>1988.</i>

13
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:26,136
<i>February 15th?</i>

14
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,126
‐Good morning, everyone.
‐ Good morning.

15
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:37,359
Well, Satoru,
you gonna take your seat?

16
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,989
Huh? Oh, yes, sir.

17
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:42,789
<i>Where was my seat again?</i>

18
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:50,030
You still asleep or something?

19
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,999
That's Kayo's desk,
you doofus.

20
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,567
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,035
No Kayo.

22
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,904
I'll have to mark her
tardy again.

23
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,842
Satoru, are you, like,
in love with Kayo?

24
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,344
Huh?

25
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:08,115
You'd make a cute couple.
You're both weird.

26
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:10,017
Here we go, folks.

27
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:13,053
- ‐ Is this for real?
-  ‐

28
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,547
<i>Why did I get dropped</i>
<i>back to this time?</i>

29
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,857
Here! Here! Here!

30
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,494
‐Here! Here...
<i>‐What's going on?</i>

31
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,629
<i>This is 18 years ago.</i>

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,938
How far did you get
on Dragon Quest 3?

33
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:35,442
‐ Level 15. ‐ That's it?
‐ Nah, just testing.

34
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,911
- ‐ I'm on 25.
- ‐ You liar!

35
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,848
Hey, what's wrong?

36
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,651
Um, my head hurts
so I'm gonna see the nurse.

37
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,545
Then why are you taking
your bag?

38
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,032
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:55,093
I'll let the teacher know
where you went.

40
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,029
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

41
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,731
<i>Is this Revival?</i>

42
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,567
<i>I don't get it.</i>

43
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,736
<i>Why'd I go back this far?</i>

44
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,478
Mom!

45
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,005
H‐Hello.

46
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,340
Sorry to keep you waiting!

47
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,013
<i>It's one of the neighbors.</i>

48
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:55,921
<i>That's right,</i>
<i>she'd be at work now.</i>

49
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,306
<i>Mom...</i>

50
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:39,927
Hey there, kiddo.

51
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,204
‐ Mom!
‐What's wrong?

52
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:49,218
Nothing,
just happy to see you.

53
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:52,177
You little weirdo.
So what do you want for dinner?

54
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,626
Hamburger or meatballs?

55
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,213
Uh...

56
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:56,815
Hamburger?

57
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,498
You getting hungry or what?

58
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,333
Mm‐hmm.

59
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,544
You're in a good mood, 
not like this morning when you pitched your little fit.

60
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,767
Guess you found
your recorder, huh?

61
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,515
Yeah, I did.

62
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,884
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,921
It's nothing to cry about,
kiddo.

64
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:45,764
<i>I remember moments like this.</i>

65
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:50,636
<i>I guess back then I didn't
realize how important they'd be.</i>

66
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:54,840
<i>I let times like this slip by
without even thinking about them.</i>

67
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,011
<i>This is Revival.</i>

68
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,949
<i>It's another chance.</i>

69
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,987
<i>And there's no way</i>
<i>I'll let this one slip by.</i>

70
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,291
‐Mom...
‐Hmm?

71
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,976
It's really good.
Thank you.

72
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,397
- ‐Are you sure you're OK?
- ‐ Thanks for dinner.

73
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,199
You're welcome.

74
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>Am I supposed to do the next</i>
<i>18 years over again?</i>

75
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,523
‐Good morning, Satoru!
‐Hey, Osamu. Morning.

76
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:35,881
<i>If this is Revival,</i>
<i>then I'm here for one reason:</i>

77
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,650
<i>to stop something bad</i>
<i>from happening.</i>

78
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,255
<i>And maybe to save my mom,</i>
<i>I have to start here.</i>

79
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,057
<i>But why so far back?</i>

80
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,828
<i>Nothing seems off here.</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

81
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,174
<i>That's Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

82
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:06,211
<i>She lived alone</i>
<i>with her mom too.</i>

83
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,813
And bam.

84
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,348
Wow!

85
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,622
<i>How'd she get that?</i>

86
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,475
You know what I think
sucks about this group?

87
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,628
There's no one
to talk Dragon Quest with.

88
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,289
Huh? Uh...

89
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:28,249
I mean, Hiro's a Final Fantasy
fan and Kazu only plays shooters.

90
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,869
<i>That's Hiro and Kazu.</i>

91
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,170
<i>I remember them.</i>

92
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,306
Heck, Satoru doesn't even
have a Famicom.

93
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,507
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

94
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:39,978
Jeez, Osamu, if we all played
Dragon Quest,

95
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,346
then that's all we'd ever
talk about.

96
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,214
The cool thing
about our group is,

97
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:45,784
we all like different things
so it's never boring.

98
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,252
<i>That's Kenya.</i>

99
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,473
<i>Out of all of us,</i>
<i>he was the brainiest.</i>

100
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,557
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

101
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,125
It's kind of personal.

102
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,360
Sure. Go ahead.

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,293
Do you have
a crush on Kayo?

104
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,866
I saw you staring at her.

105
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,134
‐No way. Really?
‐He totally was.

106
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,262
This morning
he just stood there staring.

107
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,810
‐He couldn't take his eyes off her.
‐Dang it, Satoru.

108
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,829
If you're in love with her,
you should have come to me for advice.

109
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:13,014
‐Romance is right up my alley.
‐But...

110
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:16,786
No "buts" about it.
I'll fix it so's you can hook up with Kayo.

111
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,748
Could you keep your voice down?

112
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:19,523
Why?

113
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:23,555
Well, it's like...
I don't love her.

114
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,094
Just curious about her.

115
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,757
‐That's the same thing.
‐You're brave to admit it.

116
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:32,191
Don't you worry about a thing. By the end of
today, you'll be talking with your dream girl.

117
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,554
‐You're an idiot.
<i>‐Damn, she's cold.</i>

118
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,198
‐That's how you say hello?
<i>‐That's how you say hello?</i>

119
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,630
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

120
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,617
<i>Ah, crap.</i>

121
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,879
<i>I bet Kazu straight up told her</i>
<i>I have a crush on her.</i>

122
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,055
Um... Kayo?

123
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,217
I was thinking,
since we walk home the same way,

124
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:57,188
maybe we could be friends?

125
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,523
Friends?

126
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,425
What is it you like about me?

127
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,113
<i>Oh, she's a pain in the ass.</i>

128
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,099
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

129
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,830
I think I know.

130
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,736
You're just like I am.
You're fake, too.

131
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,559
<i>Wait...</i>
<i>does she know about me?</i>

132
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,411
I saw you
running home yesterday.

133
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,889
You looked happy.
Do you love your mom that much?

134
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,623
Yeah.

135
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,126
That's good.

136
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,012
Wait, Kayo, hold up!

137
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:36,308
So how about it?
You wanna be friends?

138
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,867
Are you serious?

139
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:44,014
So, like, does that mean
you'd kill to protect me?

140
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,740
<i>No, you don't get it,</i>
<i>I could have saved her!</i>

141
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,021
<i>Something bad was happening</i>
<i>to Kayo</i>

142
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,911
<i>in the days before she died.</i>

143
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:57,836
<i>Maybe if I can stop it,</i>
<i>I can save her.</i>

144
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,437
I think I know.

145
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,129
You're just like I am.
You're fake, too.

146
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,955
<i>I doubt she could tell</i>
<i>I wasn't really a kid.</i>

147
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:21,247
<i>I guess maybe I might have
been acting a little weird,</i>

148
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,717
<i>but that's pretty much</i>
<i>how I was back in those days.</i>

149
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,822
<i>I wanted friends,</i>

150
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:29,024
<i>so I tried acting like</i>
<i>the person I wanted to be.</i>

151
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,868
If you have courage,
you can do anything.

152
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:39,502
<i>It was the only way I knew how to
fit in in my middle school world.</i>

153
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,997
We were gonna
send a search party in...

154
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:46,128
<i>I bet she saw through that,</i>
<i>but she said I was like her,</i>

155
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:48,877
<i>so maybe she's hiding</i>
<i>her true self too.</i>

156
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,793
So, how'd you make out?

157
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,470
Yeah, man, you gonna tell us
how it went or what?

158
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,751
Did you guys walk home together,
did you hold hands?

159
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,920
Jeez, no. We just talked
for a little bit, that's all.

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,422
‐ Just you two, alone?
‐Mm‐hmm.

161
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,028
Sweet! That means
she totally likes you.

162
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:08,728
Dude, seriously, she never
talks to anyone alone.

163
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,900
‐You want me to give her another message? Do ya? ‐

164
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>Could they be more annoying?</i>

165
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,701
Take it easy, guys.

166
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:18,636
- ‐Pressuring him like this isn't gonna help him.
-  ‐ You're right.

167
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,243
<i>He's talking about</i>
<i>something else, but, yeah.</i>

168
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:27,781
Satoru, in sixth grade, we'll all be in
the same class again, so there's no rush.

169
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,798
Right.

170
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,417
<i>Attention, students...</i>

171
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,115
<i>When did Kayo disappear, again?</i>

172
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>I'm running out of time!</i>
‐ Hey, Satoru, come on.

173
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,592
‐ Yeah, coming.

174
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,727
Brrr!

175
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,571
It's cold. By the way,

176
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,748
where are those kick‐ass
McGregor gloves you got?

177
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,601
<i>Oh yeah. I remember I had</i>
<i>a pair of those.</i>

178
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,879
I guess maybe
I left them somewhere.

179
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:52,947
Oh. Well, they're
probably at the hideout then.

180
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:56,309
Hey, guys, can we
go to the hideout today?

181
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,833
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:00,548
Remember? We said we wouldn't
go there if it snows,

183
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,201
'cause everyone would see
our tracks.

184
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:04,023
Oh, w‐we did?

185
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,553
Oh, right, yeah.

186
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,755
‐ See you tomorrow.
‐ Later, dudes. ‐ Later.

187
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,469
- ‐ Bye.
- ‐ See ya.

188
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,051
Kenya! Thanks for speaking up.

189
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:19,928
It's like, they were making such a big deal out of it, 
I was freaking out.

190
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,893
Yeah, I bet you were.
You don't have to thank me, though.

191
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,030
By the way, about Kayo...

192
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,233
I think it's great you want
to get closer to her and all,

193
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:31,727
but I get the feeling
there's something else going on.

194
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:35,485
I don't mean to be nosy or anything, but...

195
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,822
I'm here if you need
to talk to someone.

196
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,865
And not just me.
The other guys are, too.

197
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,359
Thanks. And yeah...

198
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,901
I know everyone's
just trying to help.

199
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,162
Kazu did get Kayo
to talk to me after all.

200
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,898
So, wanna talk about it?

201
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,861
‐About what?
‐About Kayo.

202
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:56,975
‐Oh, right.
‐Did you talk to her?

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,169
Yeah. Only for a bit.

204
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:02,472
‐She even opened up a little by the end. 
‐That's good.

205
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:05,645
I know you've got a lot on your mind, 
but I was wondering...

206
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,659
‐You read the essays yet?
‐Huh?

207
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:12,552
No, I haven't.

208
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,809
There are a couple
of interesting ones.

209
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,042
You should check them out.

210
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,625
I better go.
See you tomorrow.

211
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,752
See ya.

212
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,854
<i>I think Kenya was hinting</i>

213
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,517
<i>at Kayo's essay being</i>
<i>the interesting one in this.</i>

214
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:35,261
<i>"A Town Without Me,"</i>
<i>by Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

215
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,345
<i>"When I get bigger, big enough</i>
<i>to go somewhere by myself,</i>

216
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:42,538
<i>I want to go someplace</i>
<i>far away from here.</i>

217
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:47,559
<i>I want to go to an island,</i>
<i>an island without any people,</i>

218
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:52,334
<i>an island that doesn't have any</i>
<i>pain or sadness on it either.</i>

219
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:57,617
<i>There are no grown‐ups, kids,</i>
<i>classmates or teachers.</i>

220
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,741
<i>Even my mom's not there.</i>

221
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>When I feel like</i>
<i>I wanna climb a tree,</i>

222
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,370
<i>I can climb it.</i>

223
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,927
<i>I'll go for a swim</i>
<i>if I want to.</i>

224
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,042
<i>And sleep when I want to.</i>

225
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,957
<i>On the island,</i>

226
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:14,620
<i>I'll think about what's going</i>
<i>on in the town without me.</i>

227
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:17,751
<i>Kids go to school</i>
<i>like nothing's changed,</i>

228
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,983
<i>grown‐ups go to work like</i>
<i>nothing's changed.</i>

229
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,629
<i>Mom eats her dinner</i>
<i>like nothing's changed.</i>

230
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,661
<i>And when I think about</i>
<i>the town without me,</i>

231
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:30,396
<i>I feel relief</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

232
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,965
<i>All I want is to go far away."</i>

233
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>Her essay's a cry for help.</i>

234
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,367
- ‐No doubt about it.
- ‐

235
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,234
I'm home.

236
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,539
‐Thanks for dinner.
‐Hmm?

237
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:48,815
<i>Kenya probably thought 
I was interested in her 'cause of the essay.</i>

238
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,518
<i>After reading it, now I'm</i>
<i>even more worried about her.</i>

239
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,754
‐Hey, Mom?
‐Yeah, what's up?

240
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,903
For my birthday,
can I invite some friends over?

241
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,683
Mm‐hmm, sure, but our place
is kind of small.

242
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,257
How many friends
are we talkin'?

243
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,998
Not too many, just five.

244
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,635
You know, this is the first time
you asked to have a party.

245
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,063
Should I get a big cake?

246
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,763
Yeah! Thanks, Mom.

247
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,925
<i>I know what I have to do now.</i>

248
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:16,944
<i>I have to get to know Kayo</i>
<i>even better.</i>

249
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,814
<i>I'm gonna do what I didn't</i>
<i>the first time.</i>

250
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,952
<i>If I can make her</i>
<i>do something different now,</i>

251
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,757
<i>maybe it will be enough</i>
<i>to change her fate.</i>

252
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,609
<i>Maybe it'll change everything.</i>

253
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,127
Hey, you still awake?

254
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:38,099
You said five.
Did you get yourself a girlfriend?

255
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,704
All right, good night, kiddo.

256
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:42,795
<i>Witch.</i>

257
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:45,828
<i>I just remembered something.</i>

258
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,703
<i>I didn't show my mom</i>
<i>my essay back then</i>

259
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,923
<i>because I knew she'd read it</i>
<i>and see right into my soul.</i>

260
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,767
<i>What did I write about again?</i>

261
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,971
I'm going home
and play Dragon Quest.

262
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:01,761
Me too!

263
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,786
Man, it's snowing again.
No hideout today.

264
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,591
Satoru! Kayo's leaving.
Don't you want to talk to her?

265
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,538
Osamu...

266
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,754
It's OK, Kenya.
It's no big deal.

267
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,208
And thanks, Osamu.
See ya!

268
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,917
‐See you.
‐Later, dude.

269
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,456
‐Whoa! 
‐Can you believe how brave he's gotten?

270
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,926
<i>I didn't have to run.</i>

271
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,912
<i>I already knew</i>
<i>where I'd find Kayo.</i>

272
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:29,199
<i>I was pretty sure</i>
<i>her mom was hitting her,</i>

273
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:32,236
<i>and if that was true,
she wouldn't be going home right away.</i>

274
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:35,700
<i>She'd go hang out at the park</i>
<i>until it got darker out.</i>

275
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,870
<i>Before I just thought</i>
<i>she was weird.</i>

276
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,688
<i>Not anymore.</i>

277
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,165
Kayo!

278
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:53,256
Satoru. What do you think
you're doing out here?

279
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:55,525
I was gonna say
the same thing.

280
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,597
I meant what I said,
I wanna be friends.

281
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,647
I won't kill anyone,
that's too much.

282
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,309
No duh. That was a joke.

283
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,779
<i>I hate dealing with her type.</i>

284
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,561
I know what you're
doing, Satoru.

285
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,379
You're just pretending.

286
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,732
Pretending to smile
and being nice

287
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,521
and worrying about people.

288
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,237
But I don't think
it's bad or anything.

289
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,105
I can't tell what you're
really like.

290
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:24,656
That sounds funny
coming from me.

291
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,769
Everything you said's true.
I am pretending.

292
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,651
I want people to like me.
I wanna have friends.

293
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:38,568
So I asked myself,
what can a loser like me do to have that?

294
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,239
And you know what?

295
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,447
I tried liking everyone
and it worked.

296
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:48,237
It was hard at first,
but after a while, it got easier.

297
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:52,616
Yeah.

298
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:57,008
And, like, the more you do it,
the better the chance it comes true.

299
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:01,290
The more I talk about it,
the better the chance it will come true.

300
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,444
<i>It's like</i>
<i>déjà vu all over again.</i>

301
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>To get what you want,</i>
<i>you have to make an effort.</i>

302
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,292
<i>You have to try new things</i>
<i>and keep inspiring yourself.</i>

303
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,062
<i>That's how you change.</i>

304
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,592
<i>Is that what Kayo's doing, too?</i>

305
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,979
<i>I can tell she's suffering now.</i>

306
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>But unlike me,</i>
<i>she acts like she doesn't care.</i>

307
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:25,341
<i>Pretending like she can't</i>
<i>feel anything at all.</i>

308
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,145
<i>But she's only 10.</i>

309
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:30,195
<i>She's not strong enough to
change her situation at home.</i>

310
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:33,851
Hey, Kayo,
I brought something for you.

311
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:34,916
What?

312
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,482
I'm having a birthday party
and I want you to come.

313
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:41,665
Uh... are you sure it's OK?

314
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,161
I mean, won't there be
tons of people?

315
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,402
Oh, I don't know yet.

316
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,038
But I wanted to give you
the first invitation.

317
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,933
It's on March the 2nd.

318
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,578
You're gonna come, right?

319
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,154
Uh‐huh.

320
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,564
Hey, aren't your hands cold?

321
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,623
Huh? Oh, yeah.
They kind of are.

322
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,259
I had some new gloves,
but I think I lost them.

323
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,397
<i>Take it easy, dude. You're 29.</i>

324
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,860
<i>Why are you getting</i>
<i>all flustered?</i>

325
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,601
Satoru, are you OK?

326
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:27,318
Uh... uh‐huh.
I mean, my hand's way bigger than yours, huh?

327
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:28,478
You're an idiot.

328
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:31,125
Even so...

329
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:35,614
you seem like you're OK.
It's easy talking to you.

330
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:37,763
<i>Well...</i>

331
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,799
<i>‐It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you. 
‐It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you.</i>

332
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:43,370
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

333
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,742
Wait, Kayo!

334
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,600
So, um, see ya tomorrow?

335
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:54,004
<i>She didn't have gloves</i>
<i>either, did she?</i>

336
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:01,244
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>
<i>I saw Kayo here, alone.</i>

337
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,213
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

338
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:07,685
<i>If I remember right,
they found her body after the snow melted.</i>

339
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:10,155
This time,

340
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,894
I won't leave her
standing here all alone.

341
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:15,731
This time...

342
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,418
<i>I'm going to save her.</i>
