1
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:10,986
- ‐Goddamn little...
- ‐

2
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:12,387
Mom.

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,643
Kayo! You little shit.
Where the hell have you been?!

4
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,048
Now, I'll show...

5
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,050
I should have known.

6
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,778
This was all your doing,
wasn't it?

7
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:28,380
Who the hell do you think you are hiding my kid from me?

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,742
I damn near lost my mind worrying.

9
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,830
I'm gonna sue the shit out of you for this!

10
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:36,215
She's been gone three days.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,027
In all that time, did you even bother looking for her?

12
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,254
Wait, what? Are you...?

13
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,848
So now I'm the bad guy?

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,265
You goddamn bitch!

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,331
I'll kill you!

16
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:59,492
Kayo, let go of me!

17
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:01,517
You didn't worry about her.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,693
The only person you were
worrying about was yourself.

19
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:06,095
What?

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,717
Damn it, Kayo,
let go of me right now!

21
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,753
You hear me?
I'm talking to you, you little retard!

22
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,888
Ms. Hinazuki, that's enough.

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,258
Do you think it's fun for her seeing you act like this?

24
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:58,195
That's your fault. 
You called me a piece‐of‐shit mom in front of my daughter.

25
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:01,532
Who the hell do you think you
are taking people's kids away?!

26
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:05,036
Shut up! You're the one that
beats her and throws her in sheds!

27
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:07,774
She's been gone three days and you've done jack shit!

28
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,609
I'm not gonna stand here and
get lectured by you, you brat!

29
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,829
You don't know what being a parent's like.

30
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,615
Get out of here, you...

31
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,923
Ms. Hinazuki.

32
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,020
We're with the department of Child Protective Services.

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,990
‐ Huh?
 ‐We'd like to speak to you about your daughter.

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,794
Now, we could do this the easy way
or the hard way. It's up to you.

35
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:33,598
Goddamn the both of you.

36
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,184
You tricked me.

37
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,904
Don't blame Ms. Fujinuma.
She's here because we asked her.

38
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,440
You've been avoiding us,
so we really didn't have any other choice.

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,877
I what?
I wasn't avoiding you.

40
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,512
Regardless,
we're here now.

41
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:53,184
Thank you. I'm sorry to have to drag you into this.

42
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,286
No, you don't have to be.

43
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:58,525
There were a couple things
I wanted to say to her myself.

44
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,869
I'm glad you gave me the opportunity to.

45
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,795
Last I checked,
kidnapping someone's kid was still illegal.

46
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,612
You gonna call the cops or what?

47
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:08,338
No, we're not calling anyone until we've had a chance

48
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,434
to speak to you about your daughter's welfare.

49
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,469
Huh? What are you talking about?

50
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,980
Now that she's back home with me, she'll be fine.

51
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,608
Based on the facts at hand,

52
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,876
I'm afraid we'll have to take custody of her.

53
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,471
What? I'm her mother,
you asshole.

54
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:25,070
Like the boy said, she was gone for
three days and you didn't look for her.

55
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,324
What, are you denying that?

56
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,009
That son of a...
He's the one who took her!

57
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,543
What are you people, nuts?
I'm not the criminal here!

58
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:34,692
‐ Ms. Hinazuki, please.
‐ Let's talk calmly about this.

59
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,729
OK, let's all go talk to the cops.

60
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,196
- ‐ What?
- ‐ You heard me.

61
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,691
They can settle this. Come on, Kayo.

62
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,106
- ‐ Wait, hold on.
- ‐ Please, calm down.

63
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:46,967
‐ Ms. Hinazuki.
‐ You're not helping your daughter.

64
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,229
- ‐Where are you goin'?
- ‐ goddamn it.

65
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:51,987
‐ Stop dragging your feet!
‐Kayo.

66
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,844
Move it, you little‐‐

67
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:54,903
Akemi!

68
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:00,582
Akemi.

69
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,538
Mom?

70
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,808
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:16,333
It's my fault we haven't spoken
since I made you leave that man.

72
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,749
And ever since, I've been
worrying about you and Kayo.

73
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,643
I know what it's like trying
to raise a kid all by yourself.

74
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,557
All the sacrifices you have to make.

75
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,161
It must have been tough for you.

76
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,746
And lonely too.

77
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,054
I should have taken you both in and helped you.

78
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,910
You had to deal with so much.

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,502
I should have been there for you.

80
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,915
Please don't blame her. This is my fault.

81
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,733
If I was around,
this wouldn't have happened.

82
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,566
Mom.

83
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:27,866
Mom...

84
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:30,344
Mom!

85
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,279
<i>I wasn't buying it.</i>

86
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,574
<i>If anything, she felt sorry for herself.</i>

87
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:43,220
<i>Kayo wasn't buying any of it either.</i>

88
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,556
<i>She wouldn't even look at her mom.</i>

89
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,024
<i>I don't blame her.</i>

90
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:51,640
Akemi, don't you worry about Kayo now.

91
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:55,182
I promise you,
I'll take good care of her.

92
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,235
I can't imagine what you're going through.

93
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,841
My child's the most precious thing I have.

94
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:07,706
He's my everything,
and I know Kayo was yours.

95
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,396
Thanks, Mr. Yashiro.

96
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,848
No. The reason we're all here
is because of you, Satoru.

97
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:19,310
After everything you've done and
all the courage you've shown,

98
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,147
this couldn't have ended any better.

99
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,129
Thanks to you, she's alive.

100
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,945
<i>I can barely remember my dad.</i>

101
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:32,841
<i>I wonder if he was anything like Mr. Yashiro.</i>

102
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,604
Thank you, Satoru.

103
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,057
You got me out of this nightmare.

104
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:48,971
Kayo, ready?

105
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,661
<i>"The Town Without Me,"</i>
<i>by Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

106
00:07:57,164 --> 00:08:01,265
<i>"When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself,</i>

107
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:05,002
<i>I want to go someplace far away from here.</i>

108
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,739
<i>I want to go to an island.</i>

109
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:10,050
<i>An island without any people.</i>

110
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,531
<i>An island that doesn't have any
pain or sadness on it either.</i>

111
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:22,872
<i>When I feel like I want to climb a tree,</i>

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,856
<i>I can climb it.</i>

113
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,982
<i>I'll go for a swim if I want to.</i>

114
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,445
<i>And sleep when I want to.</i>

115
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,731
<i>And when I think about the town without me,</i>

116
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,390
<i>I feel relief more than anything.</i>

117
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:45,209
<i>All I want is to go far away."</i>

118
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,560
<i>I did it.</i>

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,095
<i>I saved Kayo.</i>

120
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:07,043
<i>I changed things so she could have a future.</i>

121
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:11,897
<i>Now she has a chance to grow up
to be whatever she wants to be.</i>

122
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,538
<i>She's on her way.</i>

123
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,374
<i>And I have a feeling she's gonna be just fine.</i>

124
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,419
Is he OK?
 He's been like this ever since Kayo left.

125
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,554
Ah, he's in hibernation mode.

126
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,758
Being a superhero takes a lot out of a guy.

127
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:35,260
Hey, Satoru, 
are you OK?

128
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,162
Yeah,
 great.

129
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,479
I don't know, dude, you don't look it.

130
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,902
Jeez, can you blame him?
I mean, his girlfriend moved to another town.

131
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:46,171
Well, the important thing is she's safe now.

132
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,007
‐
‐ Satoru.

133
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,124
Can I see you for a sec?

134
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,611
I have some news.

135
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:55,414
Kayo's grandmother has full custody of her now.

136
00:09:55,414 --> 00:10:00,019
And as for Kayo's mother, the authorities
aren't gonna let her see her for a while.

137
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:02,288
Thank you, Mr. Yashiro.

138
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,623
Well, you deserve to know.

139
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,792
Hmm‐mm. It's not about that.

140
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:11,664
You said it couldn't have ended any better
after what I did and the courage I showed.

141
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:14,900
I just wanted to let you know that meant a lot to me.

142
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:18,523
Well, actually, I wanted to say

143
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,783
you deserved to be rewarded for your courage,

144
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,375
but that would have sounded awful.

145
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,359
Not that you shouldn't be rewarded,

146
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,895
because if anyone deserves to be it's you.

147
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:31,316
I bet seeing Kayo's smile was your reward, wasn't it?

148
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,641
Your smile was mine.

149
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,560
Oh, by the way, where was Kayo staying?

150
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,695
At your house?

151
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:45,667
‐No, not there. We hid her.
 ‐Seriously?

152
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,860
Yep. We set her up in this old bus

153
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:50,320
Izumi Elementary's hockey club used to use.

154
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:53,318
Huh? I guess if you want to kidnap someone,

155
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:55,216
that's a perfect place to take them, huh?

156
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,550
I guess.

157
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:58,596
<i>If he only knew.</i>

158
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,651
<i>Even though Kayo's safe now,</i>

159
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,361
<i>Aya Nakanishi and Hiromi are still in danger.</i>

160
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,743
<i>I have to figure out a way to make
sure neither of them are left alone.</i>

161
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,837
<i>Like how I did with Kayo.</i>

162
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,696
<i>Hiromi's my friend and I'm with him all the time,</i>

163
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,393
<i>but Aya goes to a different school, and I don't know her,</i>

164
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,231
<i>so how do I approach her?</i>

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,119
<i>I heard she sometimes hangs out with Yuuki,</i>

166
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:28,865
<i>so maybe he's my "in."</i>

167
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,047
<i>I don't know her, she doesn't know me.</i>

168
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,253
<i>This is gonna be tough.</i>

169
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,885
Wait, how do you make friends
with someone you don't know?

170
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:43,851
Easy. Be honest, and say something like, 
"Hey, you, let's be friends."

171
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,324
That's never gonna...

172
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:48,087
You're thinking that's never gonna work, but it might.

173
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,471
<i>Psychic witch!</i>

174
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:52,272
I can't believe you're already
looking for another girlfriend.

175
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,399
Uh...
How do you know I am?

176
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,634
I didn't, but I do now.

177
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,588
You're right,
this person's a girl.

178
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,595
But I just wanna be her friend.

179
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,677
Well, if that's what you want,
then what's the harm in asking?

180
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:07,947
To get what you want in life,
you have to think positively.

181
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,414
You never know till you try.

182
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,186
I have to go somewhere really quick.

183
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,957
Is it cool if I meet you guys at the Children's Center?

184
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,638
‐ Yeah, sure. 
‐ OK. See you guys in a little bit.

185
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,907
 ‐ Later.
 ‐ See ya.

186
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:38,377
<i>Looks like her class gets out at 6:30.</i>

187
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:41,647
<i>I can walk Hiromi home and be back here in time.</i>

188
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:45,282
<i>I have to get familiar with Aya's daily routine.</i>

189
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>Aya pretty much kept to a straightforward schedule.</i>

190
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,982
<i>If someone wanted to kidnap her,</i>

191
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,477
<i>the best time would be right now,
after she got out of cram school.</i>

192
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,873
Satoru.

193
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:11,276
I need you muscles.
Come on, shake a leg.

194
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:13,478
<i>Why'd she have to show up now?</i>

195
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,280
<i>I'm trying to find out where Aya lives.</i>

196
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,403
Why the heck do you buy all this stuff?

197
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,463
Couldn't help it. It was cheap.

198
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,790
It's heavy.

199
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,764
God, stop complaining. It'll only make it heavier.

200
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:25,426
It would be as heavy either way.

201
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,035
You're a lifesaver, sir.

202
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,162
Mom sort of went nuts at the store.

203
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,706
I did not go nuts.

204
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:37,939
Ah...

205
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:45,172
So, Mr. Yoshiro,
how come you're not married?

206
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,120
That came out of nowhere.

207
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,162
Hmm. It's like this.

208
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,023
Getting married depends on finding the right partner.

209
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,383
It depends on timing and whether
they want to marry you and...

210
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,934
Well, other things.

211
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:01,694
Me, I already failed horribly at it once,

212
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:03,963
so I guess I'm just being extra cautious.

213
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,401
Sorry, I didn't mean to, um...

214
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,199
It's OK.
It's all in the past now.

215
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:16,187
I was wondering if you could give me some advice.

216
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,545
How to approach a girl you don't know, huh?

217
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,849
Yeah. I know a couple things about her, but that's it.

218
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:27,052
Let's see, how would I go about doing that?

219
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,490
I guess I'd get her to drop her guard
first and that way I won't freak her out.

220
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,258
‐How do I do that?
‐Easy.

221
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:36,495
When you're around her, be yourself, that's all.

222
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:39,164
Whatever you're into, be it sports or cooking,

223
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,233
your interests make you interesting.

224
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,168
Your enthusiasm will make her curious

225
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,070
and then she'll drop her guard.

226
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,338
Wow!

227
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,273
I wish it were that impressive.

228
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,575
No, I'm bad at expressing my feelings directly

229
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,845
so I've gotten good at relying on logic.

230
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,016
What's this doing here?

231
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:00,886
No, no, don't touch it!

232
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,553
I didn't mean to...

233
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:04,323
What the...?

234
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:07,938
Well...
My secret's out.

235
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,898
<i>Candy?</i>

236
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,768
There's no sense in hiding the truth anymore.

237
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,871
Don't just sit there.
Help me eat the evidence.

238
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,406
I quit smoking three years ago,

239
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,808
and candy's the only thing that helps stop the cravings.

240
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:30,069
I find someplace private,
jam a couple of these in my mouth, and I'm good.

241
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,817
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

242
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,093
Thank you.

243
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,911
Can I bum one of those off ya?

244
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:43,653
Sure.

245
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,793
I'm going over to the Children's Center to do my homework.

246
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:54,674
OK, um, if you wait a sec, I'll go with you.

247
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:57,922
Are you gonna be Hiromi's bodyguard now that Kayo's gone?

248
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,144
It's not like that.

249
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,914
Satoru, can I talk to you for a sec?

250
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,516
Uh‐huh.

251
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,638
‐Sorry. I'll catch up in a few, OK?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

252
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,023
I have no idea what's going on with you lately.

253
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:17,443
You made it your mission to save Kayo and you did, 
so what's bothering you?

254
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,564
You always look so intense,

255
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,659
like you're still trying to fix
whatever it is that needs fixing.

256
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:26,579
If something's bugging you,
I wish you'd just tell me about it.

257
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:29,809
I can't really explain what it is.

258
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,811
I'm still trying to figure it out.

259
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,782
Then let me help you figure it out.

260
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,296
I'd like the chance to be a hero, too.

261
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:44,217
Whatever you're up to,
I'd like to come along.

262
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,999
Check it out. What do you think of these footprints?

263
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,757
A grown‐up was here. They came and left.

264
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,877
Yeah, but no tread.

265
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:00,927
It's like he wrapped his shoes in something.

266
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,335
Why? They'd be super slippy.

267
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,805
Maybe to hide the tread pattern.

268
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,539
Look, the backpack's gone.

269
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,659
Crap, the box with the stove, too.

270
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,927
Quite a few boxes are missing.

271
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,936
And he tore some open.

272
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,764
He didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

273
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,270
Satoru, where are you going with this?

274
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,406
You guys remember what Kayo told us?

275
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:37,910
‐That night she was here alone and
she heard someone come in? ‐Yeah.

276
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,981
He left a backpack full of creepy junk. So what?

277
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:46,592
I think that guy, whoever he is,
is a serial killer who targets kids.

278
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:49,287
Wait, a serial killer?
You're joking.

279
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:53,133
No, I'm not. I know it's hard to believe, 
but that's what I think.

280
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:57,062
OK, but like... why?

281
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,132
I wish I could explain it to you guys, but I can't.

282
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:03,402
When I saw the stuff in the
backpack and the stove and charcoal,

283
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:07,306
I thought maybe the killer was
using this as their home base.

284
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:08,941
I know, guys.

285
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:12,244
Everything I just said to you sounds totally crazy.

286
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:14,313
But even so, I think I'm right.

287
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,642
As for Kayo, the truth is,

288
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:21,420
it wasn't just 'cause her mom beat her
that I didn't want to leave her alone.

289
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,282
I was also protecting her from the killer.

290
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:32,998
Jeez. It's so out there,
it's like the plot of some detective story.

291
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:37,575
But the real issue here isn't whether
we believe in your theory or not.

292
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,466
It's about whether we believe in you or not.

293
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,869
You don't have to walk me all the way home.

294
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:47,941
I can take care of myself, you know.

295
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,935
I had to swing by here for something else anyway.

296
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,839
‐Satoru?
‐What?

297
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,158
I believe what you told us before,

298
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,521
and I'll do whatever I can to help out.
You can totally count on me.

299
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,584
You're the best.

300
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,652
‐ See ya! 
‐Good night, Hiromi. See you later!

301
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,419
I have to be honest here, Satoru.

302
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,257
After hearing your story,
I'm about 99% sure it's nonsense.

303
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:29,528
But still, there's a 1% chance everything you said's true.

304
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:33,465
Well, from your point of view,
I get how you think I'm making it up

305
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,740
and just playing detective.

306
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,582
You should keep playing detective.

307
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,797
I don't know what that stuff we found here was for,

308
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:44,058
but you seem to really believe something's up,

309
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,886
and that makes me think that you might be onto something.

310
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,280
Mm‐hmm.

311
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,650
Besides, you trusted us enough to tell us about it.

312
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,048
If you believe in us that much,
we believe in you.

313
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,332
If someone believes in you, you're not alone.

314
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:02,728
And if I was in your situation,
I'd want someone to believe me.

315
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:07,608
Thank you, Kenya.
You too, Hiromi.

316
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,679
You don't get it,
I could have saved her!

317
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,640
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>

318
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:17,267
<i>I was crying when I said that to my mom.</i>

319
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,749
<i>I don't wanna feel that kind of guilt again.</i>

320
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:25,331
<i>I'm the only one who can stop this,</i>

321
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,792
<i>the only one who can save them.</i>

322
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:37,034
Remember to get your parent's signature. Don't forget now.

323
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,668
I need you guys to come with me, but just us, OK?

324
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,597
Mm‐hmm.

325
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,811
Hey, Satoru, today's a good day to go to the hideout.

326
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:50,710
Actually, we have to take care of something.

327
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,477
- ‐ Hmm?
- ‐ Sorry about that.

328
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:55,371
‐ Yeah, sorry.
‐That's cool. ‐See ya.

329
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,428
I wonder what the heck those dudes are up to.

330
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,656
They're acting weird.

331
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:02,082
‐Wanna follow 'em?
‐Mm‐hmm.

332
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,302
- ‐ Come on'!
- ‐ Right behind ya!
