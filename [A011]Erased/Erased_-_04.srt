1
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:04,433
<i>March 1st, 18 years ago.</i>

2
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:09,138
<i>On my way home, I saw Kayo</i>
<i>standing alone in the park.</i>

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:11,907
<i>I guess it was</i>
<i>a little before 6:00.</i>

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:16,678
<i>That night I was on my way</i>
<i>to the hideout.</i>

5
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:19,881
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>to try and find my gloves.</i>

6
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,119
<i>But I don't remember if I</i>
<i>found them there or not.</i>

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,523
<i>After I left, I saw Yuuki</i>
<i>sitting by himself on the bank,</i>

8
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,992
<i>looking out at the river.</i>

9
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,503
<i>On the way back home,</i>

10
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:34,466
<i>I took a shortcut that took me</i>
<i>by the park again.</i>

11
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>But this time when I looked in,</i>
<i>Kayo was gone.</i>

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,961
Let's talk
about averages.

13
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:46,908
<i>A week from now,</i>
<i>Kayo will be the first victim</i>

14
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:49,945
<i>in a series</i>
<i>of kidnappings and murders.</i>

15
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,148
<i>Day X.</i>

16
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:55,017
<i>If I can get her</i>
<i>to survive March 1st</i>

17
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:57,486
<i>and spend the 2nd with me</i>
<i>at my birthday party,</i>

18
00:00:57,486 --> 00:01:00,622
<i>that should be enough</i>
<i>to change her future.</i>

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,294
<i>I'm not gonna let her die.</i>

20
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:39,585
Good morning,
you sleepy head.

21
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,752
Morning.

22
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,322
Up and at 'em.
Food's almost ready.

23
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:44,974
OK.

24
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,059
Thanks for breakfast.

25
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:50,329
Uh, hey, Mom?

26
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:51,856
Hmm?

27
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,483
I was thinking
of going out this Saturday.

28
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,776
Like on a date?

29
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,357
No! I was gonna go to the
Science Center with some friends.

30
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:03,065
Oh, well. If it were a date,
I'd give you spending cash.

31
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,362
<i>Shit, for real?</i>

32
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:07,619
‐It is a date, isn't it?
‐Mm‐hmm.

33
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,883
Then bring her by.
I'd love to meet her.

34
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,617
We can have hotpot
or something.

35
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:14,220
Actually, I invited Kayo
to the party.

36
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,812
Oh. Kayo from
a few streets over, huh?

37
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,692
<i>Damn, she's good at getting</i>
<i>info out of people.</i>

38
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,120
You can go.
Just be safe.

39
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,464
Thanks, Mom.

40
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,366
Hurry up and finish
your breakfast, kiddo.

41
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,101
Mm‐hmm.

42
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:32,671
- ‐ Stand... bow.
- ‐ Bye!

43
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,174
Liveman's gonna be on.
Cool, huh?

44
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,643
- ‐ What's a falcon?
- ‐ It's a bird, duh!

45
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,472
You're so smart.

46
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,135
<i>This Saturday,</i>
<i>Kayo's not staying home.</i>

47
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,041
<i>I'm gonna take her away</i>
<i>from her mom and the beatings.</i>

48
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,507
- ‐ Mr. Yashiro?
- ‐ Um, sir?

49
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,570
What's up, guys?

50
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,637
Can you explain this?
I don't get it.

51
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,481
Sure. Hmm. That's a tough one.

52
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,230
What a bunch
of flirty little tramps.

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,665
Ecch.

54
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:03,883
What are you talking about?
It's not like you never did that too, you know.

55
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,581
Instead of dissing him, go up
there and show him who's boss.

56
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,639
What's "dis" mean?
You trying to sound cool?

57
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,945
<i>Oh! Gotta watch what I say.</i>

58
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,482
The teacher doesn't care about me
anymore, he thinks I'm a thief.

59
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,485
Bet you do, too.

60
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,253
Not that I care.

61
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:27,293
Hey, guys,
I got an idea.

62
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,560
Oh, yeah? What is it?

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,098
Um, let's go to
the Science Center on Saturday.

64
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:35,667
‐I'll ask Kayo to go, too.
‐Yeah, that's a great idea!

65
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,865
‐Ohhh!
‐I can't make it.

66
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,938
Sorry, but I've already
made plans that day.

67
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,607
Oh, really?

68
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,342
Uh, same for me, too, dude.

69
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,477
I, uh, got some important things
need doing.

70
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:49,581
Yeah, what he said.
I'd like to go, but I can't either. Sorry.

71
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,650
- ‐Yeah, me too.
- ‐ Oh.

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,720
It's better if it's
just you and Kayo anyway.

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,956
See ya.

74
00:04:56,956 --> 00:05:00,226
Satoru, everything OK?

75
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,394
Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:06,286
I told them I couldn't hang out
Saturday 'cause I had a date with you.

77
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,434
<i>What a lie.</i>

78
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,736
<i>I did it again.</i>

79
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:17,143
But... my mom wants me to get
home early Saturday, so...

80
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,578
I just wanna take you
someplace cool.

81
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:22,314
I'll ask her
and get permission.

82
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,917
Kenya.

83
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,154
Could I see you in
the faculty office for a sec?

84
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:31,357
No way. You kids are
too young to go out on a date.

85
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:34,994
But it's more like a field trip.
 We'll be learning stuff.

86
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:37,263
You can stay home
and learn stuff.

87
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:40,466
Besides, Kayo helps me
around the house Saturdays.

88
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,301
Oh, yeah, with what?

89
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,636
<i>Blowing off steam?</i>
<i>Your right hook?</i>

90
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,629
Little smart ass, I don't
have to tell you a damn thing.

91
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,459
I just wanna know why you
don't want Kayo to go with me.

92
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,544
I got
a zillion reasons why.

93
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,580
First, you guys are too young
to be dating.

94
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,516
Second, who's responsible
if something happens? You?

95
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:00,719
<i>Don't even go there</i>
<i>with me, bitch.</i>

96
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,288
What's your problem?

97
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,490
What do you get
out of taking her anywhere?

98
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,292
She's just a gloomy little girl.

99
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:09,361
I'm not getting anything.
All I want's to keep her safe!

100
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,629
Safe, huh?

101
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,665
What do you think
you're keeping her safe from?

102
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,634
You her knight
in shining armor?

103
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:16,980
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

104
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,805
<i>Now she knows I know</i>
<i>she beats on her.</i>

105
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:24,376
What do you want to do, Kayo?
You wanna go out with him?

106
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:31,423
Uggh! You're not going
anywhere, you slut!

107
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,818
Mom!

108
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,671
Watch it, Ms. Hinazuki.

109
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:37,656
You shouldn't say nasty things
like that about your daughter.

110
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:40,534
Ms. Fujinuma, I...

111
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,049
This isn't any of your business.

112
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,632
Actually, half of this
is my business.

113
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:50,236
A trip to the Science Center can
be very educational for a kid.

114
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,104
Don't you think
we should encourage that?

115
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,406
We are their parents.

116
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:58,110
I'm a single mom, too, so I know
how tough it can get.

117
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,179
Come by sometime
and we'll talk.

118
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,851
Kayo, get inside.

119
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,152
OK.

120
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:08,988
So, Saturday, I'll see you then.

121
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,427
Did I screw everything up?

122
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,363
No. You were great.

123
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:21,283
Guess it's lucky
I showed up when I did.

124
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,871
I got off work early and saw you,
so naturally I had to follow you.

125
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,338
What do you mean
"naturally"?

126
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:29,475
Oh, nothing.
I'm just kidding, is all.

127
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:33,846
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about Kayo tonight.

128
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:36,515
Did you notice how nice
her clothes were?

129
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:40,452
Her mom goes to a lot of trouble
to make her look presentable.

130
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,822
Do you know what's
going on over there?

131
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:46,286
I didn't, but after
what I just heard and saw,

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,002
I have my suspicions.

133
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:50,529
<i>My mom wasn't a reporter</i>
<i>for nothing.</i>

134
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:54,033
‐ Kayo's a cutie, isn't she?
 ‐Uh...

135
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,002
<i>Dude, you're 29!</i>

136
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:59,972
‐ ‐ Hang in there,
kiddo, for her.

137
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,135
I will.

138
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,878
<i>It's Saturday,</i>
<i>February the 27th.</i>

139
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:09,815
<i>It's sunny and clear,</i>
<i>and for the last couple days,</i>

140
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:13,501
<i>Kayo's mom hasn't beaten her
up, just like my mom said.</i>

141
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,189
Lookit, he's my friend.

142
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,149
You're an idiot.

143
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:22,962
Isn't this place the coolest?
 I love it!

144
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,532
I think we're
the only ones here.

145
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,236
When it's quiet like this,
I pretend I snuck in.

146
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:33,489
Then, if someone comes,
I hide from them.

147
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,276
<i>Huh. She didn't call me</i>
<i>an idiot.</i>

148
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,278
Take a look inside this thing.

149
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,953
You wanna check out the next
show in the planetarium?

150
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:59,016
We already saw
enough stars on the mountain.

151
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah, I guess.

152
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,904
Hey, I have to use
the bathroom.

153
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,827
OK. I'll be here.

154
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,693
<i>What the heck was that</i>
<i>feeling back there?</i>

155
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,051
<i>It was like déjà vu.</i>

156
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>I remember coming here a lot,</i>

157
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:25,324
<i>but this is my first time</i>
<i>with Kayo.</i>

158
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,799
I'm back.

159
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:38,204
Satoru, thanks for inviting me
to come today.

160
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:41,007
Did you know that I like
to come here, too?

161
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,209
<i>Wait, did I?</i>

162
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,777
<i>Is that why I chose it?</i>

163
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,547
<i>Or...</i> <i>is this</i>
<i>someplace special for me/you,</i>

164
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,483
<i>'cause like I/you wanna</i>
<i>make manga and stuff?</i>

165
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:58,136
<i>We talked about the same thing</i>
<i>18 years ago.</i>

166
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,159
<i>Now I remember.</i>

167
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,030
<i>I came here by myself</i>
<i>and ran into Kayo.</i>

168
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,098
- ‐What's wrong?
- ‐

169
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, uh, maybe...

170
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:12,771
<i>Am I just repeating things?</i>

171
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:15,788
<i>Have I been doing it</i>
<i>unconsciously this whole time</i>

172
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,786
<i>and... not changing</i>
<i>the future at all?</i>

173
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:33,554
‐Hey, Kayo, lemme carry that.
‐OK.

174
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:37,696
<i>But there's so much that has changed
because of what I did different.</i>

175
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:40,732
<i>I</i> can <i>change the future.</i>
<i>I can.</i>

176
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:42,168
Satoru...

177
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:47,139
I'm glad I had the guts
to come today.

178
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,360
Mm‐hmm.

179
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,179
- ‐ Hey, guys.
- ‐ Hi, Kayo.

180
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,212
What's up?

181
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,540
I finished the stuff
I had to do early.

182
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,167
Sorry we got here so late.

183
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,754
<i>There, it changed.</i>

184
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:06,292
- ‐Is it OK we came?
- ‐ Yeah, of course it is.

185
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,027
- ‐ Right, Kayo?
- ‐ Mm‐hmm.

186
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,212
Hey, wanna hold
our coats, too?

187
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,289
Hi, Satoru. Good morning.

188
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,182
Oh, hey, Kayo. Morning.

189
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:29,857
<i>Yes! She's here on time</i>
<i>on a Monday.</i>

190
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>Damn, you're pretty.</i>

191
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,368
Uh...

192
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,946
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

193
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:38,308
‐
‐ No way!

194
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,701
Satoru's so rad!

195
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,469
They're gonna
get married!

196
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,605
They gotta get engaged
first, ya lame‐brain.

197
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,225
- ‐ What's "engaged" mean?
- ‐ Congrats, you guys.

198
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,153
Settle down.
Let's do some learning today.

199
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:54,149
<i>Tomorrow's the day</i>
<i>Kayo disappears.</i>

200
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,887
<i>March 1st.</i>

201
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,081
- ‐The moment of truth.
- ‐

202
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:03,725
‐ Later, Hiromi.
‐Yep, see you tomorrow.

203
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:07,255
Hey, Kayo, wanna walk
to school together?

204
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,061
- ‐I could swing by your place.
- ‐ OK.

205
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,847
Mom.

206
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,567
Hello.

207
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,444
I'll come and get you
tomorrow morning. Bye!

208
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:29,017
‐See you later, Mom.
‐OK.

209
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,695
<i>I left the house</i>
<i>a little early.</i>

210
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,432
<i>It's March 1st, 1988.</i>

211
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,266
<i>Kayo was kidnapped</i>
<i>18 years ago today.</i>

212
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,486
It's me, Kayo.

213
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,156
<i>But things are different now.</i>

214
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,439
Good morning, Satoru.

215
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,840
Good morning.

216
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,138
<i>No one's gonna hurt her.</i>

217
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,356
Bye, Ms. Hinazuki.

218
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:10,079
<i>A lot of things have changed between
this time 18 years ago and now.</i>

219
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,702
They're holding hands
and everything now.

220
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,971
<i>Kayo was targeted because she</i>
<i>was always alone at the park.</i>

221
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,331
<i>But she's not alone anymore.</i>

222
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,230
You guys are all still coming
over tomorrow night, right?

223
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:22,890
‐Yeah. ‐Of course.
‐Yep.

224
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,352
<i>She's had friends to hang out</i>
<i>with the past few days.</i>

225
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:30,394
‐I know. Wanna go play a game?
‐Uh...

226
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:33,448
<i>And today she's with me.</i>

227
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:36,222
I kind of wanted to get home
early today.

228
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:39,416
Come on, don't be like that.
We'll have fun.

229
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,810
OK.

230
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,303
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

231
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,596
Looks like
I won again.

232
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,820
You're good.

233
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,456
<i>This sucks.</i>

234
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:52,935
Satoru, I should be
getting home.

235
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:55,570
Yeah.
It's getting late.

236
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,600
It's snowing.

237
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,605
I'll come by
tomorrow, too.

238
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,369
See you in the morning!

239
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,496
Bye.

240
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,646
<i>I said it loud like that</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

241
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:14,316
<i>That way, everyone heard me.</i>

242
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:19,687
<i>Kayo, her mom, and anyone else</i>
<i>who might be out there.</i>

243
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,091
<i>They know I'm here now.</i>

244
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:30,498
<i>Day X is almost over.</i>
<i>It's too good to be true.</i>

245
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,307
<i>I'm such a dumb ass.</i>

246
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:42,835
<i>Like this is gonna change</i>
<i>anything.</i>

247
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,960
<i>I did it!</i>

248
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:58,954
<i>The day's over.</i>

249
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,314
<i>I changed history.</i>

250
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,750
‐
‐ Good morning, Mom.

251
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,606
What the...?
It's not even 6:00.

252
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,138
‐ I know. Bye!
‐What about breakfast?!

253
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,483
<i>I couldn't sleep</i>
<i>after I got home.</i>

254
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,681
<i>I wanted to see Kayo again,</i>
<i>no matter how early it was.</i>

255
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,626
Morning. Sleep well?

256
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,586
You're an idiot.

257
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:48,113
‐ Are you guys still on for tonight?
 ‐Yeah, dude, you know it.

258
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,950
If there's one thing I like more than cake, 
it's birthday cake.

259
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,262
Cool. You guys want to hit the market with me...?

260
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,411
Hey!Satoru, Kayo.
I need your help putting these boxes away.

261
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,339
Huh? Can't it wait
till tomorrow?

262
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,638
It sort of figures.

263
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,822
We blew off the last time
we had cleaning duties.

264
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:09,850
I guess.
Man, this is heavy.

265
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,346
Some friends
they turned out to be.

266
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,740
Those doofuses
totally bailed on us.

267
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:19,976
‐ That'll be 5,000 yen, please.
 ‐OK.

268
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,883
<i>Wait a sec.</i>
<i>It cost 5,000 back then, too.</i>

269
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,452
<i>I remember I was so stoked</i>
<i>about it being my birthday,</i>

270
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:30,866
<i>I spent all I had.</i>

271
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:35,020
<i>We made a ton of sandwiches,
but since it was just my mom and me,</i>

272
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,680
<i>we had a lot left over.</i>

273
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:41,755
I'm home.

274
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,573
‐
‐

275
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,934
Ready and...

276
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,295
Kayo, Satoru!

277
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,601
‐Happy birthday!
‐Happy birthday, guys!

278
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,024
Wait. Mom,
you knew about this?

279
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,099
I helped out a little,

280
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:59,287
but they're the real masterminds
behind this evil scheme.

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,744
So then, today,
those chores were planned, too?

282
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,412
Uh‐huh. We asked Mr. Yashiro
to stall you.

283
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,317
He also told us it was
Kayo's birthday today.

284
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:12,051
Guess our little
surprise worked, huh?

285
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,377
Uh, yeah.

286
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,094
Guess what, Kayo.

287
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,245
Satoru insisted on getting
a cake just for you.

288
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,587
I'm sorry, Satoru.
I tried.

289
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,945
But I couldn't finish
your present in time.

290
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,806
Seriously? You were
making me something?

291
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:28,868
Mm‐hmm.

292
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,603
<i>That's why she wanted
to get home early yesterday.</i>

293
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:37,089
Last night, I fell asleep
before I could finish it.

294
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,315
That's OK.

295
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,125
You can give it to me later.

296
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,049
Hey, guys.

297
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:45,644
Let's make 5,000 yen
worth of sandwiches!

298
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,248
- ‐ ‐ What?
-  You spent all the money?

299
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,633
<i>We all had a blast making</i>
<i>those sandwiches together.</i>

300
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:59,921
<i>But this time, there weren't any
left over at the end of the night.</i>

301
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:03,731
<i>Friends are the best, no doubt.</i>

302
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,936
<i>Everyone brought presents</i>
<i>for Kayo and me.</i>

303
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,922
<i>Talk about a haul.</i>
<i>And then...</i>

304
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,441
That's from me.

305
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,385
Thank you, Satoru.

306
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,787
Thank you, everyone.

307
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,894
You can leave
the cleaning up to us.

308
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,955
Yeah. Walk Kayo home.

309
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,210
‐It's so cold!
‐You're an idiot.

310
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,631
G‐Good night.

311
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,767
Here. Thank you for today.

312
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:47,056
I'm glad I got to be friends
with you and the others.

313
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,629
I'll give you your present
tomorrow.

314
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:52,031
Promise.

315
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,527
Mm‐hmm. Can't wait.

316
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,554
‐Good night.
‐Good night.

317
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:13,944
<i>I did it. I did it.</i>

318
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,780
<i>It worked!</i>

319
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:18,371
<i>I changed history.</i>

320
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,301
<i>Everyone had left</i>
<i>by the time I got home.</i>

321
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,440
<i>I was so exhausted</i>
<i>from the past few days,</i>

322
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:34,771
<i>all that built‐up tension</i>
<i>finally popped.</i>

323
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:38,676
<i>I collapsed on my futon</i>
<i>and slept like a log.</i>

324
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,634
<i>Son of a bitch, I'm late!</i>

325
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,847
I'm here, sir, sorry!

326
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,075
Just in time. I was about
to mark you tardy.

327
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,101
<i>Made it.</i>

328
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:57,902
OK. Does anyone know
if Kayo's coming today?

329
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:13,572
<i>Kayo didn't show up that day.</i>
<i>Or the next one.</i>

330
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,714
<i>And that promise she made me...</i>

331
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,085
<i>she never got to keep it.</i>
