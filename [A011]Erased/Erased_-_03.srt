1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:03,071
I'm having a birthday
party and I want you to come.

2
00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:03,753
Uh...

3
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:08,908
You seem like you're OK.
It's easy talking to you.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,259
<i>Well...</i>

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,934
‐It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you.
<i>‐It's 'cause I decided to be honest with you.</i>

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,610
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

7
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:20,786
Wait, Kayo!

8
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:23,445
So, um, see ya tomorrow?

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,480
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>
<i>I saw Kayo here, alone.</i>

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,205
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

11
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:34,327
<i>They found her body</i>
<i>after the snow melted.</i>

12
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,139
<i>I remember she got</i>
<i>kidnapped in March.</i>

13
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:39,141
<i>But what day was it?</i>

14
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,405
<i>That's what I</i>
<i>have to figure out now.</i>

15
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,457
<i>Aya Nakanishi, Hiromi Sugita.</i>

16
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,342
<i>That's right, Hiromi.</i>

17
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,050
<i>Kayo was the only one</i>
<i>who was 10.</i>

18
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,773
<i>That means she was kidnapped</i>
<i>before her birthday.</i>

19
00:00:58,115 --> 00:00:59,353
<i>That's it!</i>

20
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:03,047
<i>The day I'm looking for is between
March 1st and Kayo's birthday.</i>

21
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,445
<i>Day X.</i>

22
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,812
Whoa! Ow!

23
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:45,228
Did you guys hear?
The boys are gonna race one‐on‐one.

24
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,458
‐ Big deal.
‐ Why? What's the matter?

25
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:51,352
‐Why can't the girls...? 
‐I betcha Hamada's gonna get the fastest time again.

26
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:52,375
Maybe.

27
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,343
Hamada!
You're the awesomest‐est!

28
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,583
God, shut up.

29
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,647
‐
‐Don't expect me to hold back.

30
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,320
No.

31
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,961
<i>Hamada's</i>
<i>on the school's hockey team.</i>

32
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,842
<i>They won</i>
<i>the national championship.</i>

33
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,885
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>I did race him.</i>

34
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,795
Satoru's
gonna race Hamada next.

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,155
He doesn't stand a chance.

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,745
Well, Kayo, you gonna cheer
your boyfriend on?

37
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,977
‐ ‐Yeah!
 ‐Come on, let's hear it.

38
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,702
Satoru, you got this?

39
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,835
Uh‐huh, I think so.

40
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,448
Good. You better not suck.

41
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,475
On your mark, guys.

42
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,288
Get set.

43
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:46,768
‐
‐ Crap!

44
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,835
‐Go!
‐Faster!

45
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,270
‐What are you doing, Hamada?
‐Move it!

46
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,746
Damn, he's fast.

47
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,075
Satoru totally
jumped the gun.

48
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,097
<i>I can beat him, I can win.</i>

49
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,622
<i>But should I?</i>

50
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:11,478
<i>He's the one training</i>
<i>like a fiend every day.</i>

51
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,090
<i>He deserves it.</i>

52
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,521
I so totally knew
he'd win!

53
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:27,559
That was rad!

54
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,648
He was so close,
but he still kicked butt.

55
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:31,607
Right, Kenya?

56
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,261
You asshole.

57
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:40,850
What, you think you're
doing me a favor?

58
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,858
I hate you!

59
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,936
‐Satoru.
‐That was super close.

60
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:48,992
Shut up!

61
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,593
What crawled up his butt?

62
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,101
He's probably just mad
'cause he almost lost.

63
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,174
It's cool.

64
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,034
<i>I remember.</i>

65
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:03,268
You think you're doing me a favor?
 I hate you!

66
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:04,741
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

67
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,735
<i>I did the same thing</i>
<i>18 years ago.</i>

68
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:17,842
Kayo, wait up!

69
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,701
Hamada was faster than
I thought.

70
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,642
Yeah.

71
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,130
So, uh, what day
is your birthday?

72
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,111
What's wrong?

73
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,248
Didn't you say you were
gonna be honest with me?

74
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:43,627
I know, but I thought Hamada
deserved to win more than me.

75
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh.

76
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:47,135
Sorry.

77
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,283
It's fine.

78
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,770
After all, you and me
are fakes and liars.

79
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,818
Satoru, wanna walk home?

80
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:06,532
I forgot something.
I'll catch up!

81
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,118
Hey, what ya doing there?

82
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,951
Mr. Yashiro.

83
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,842
I, uh...

84
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,798
Is it about Kayo?

85
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,432
<i>Whoa, he's sharp.</i>

86
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,985
I wanted to know her birthday.
Sorry, sir.

87
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,639
No worries.

88
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,218
By the way, I've noticed
you two have gotten friendly.

89
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,979
I don't know about that.

90
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,692
Well, why didn't you
just ask her?

91
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:54,511
I told her when mine is,
but she wouldn't tell me hers.

92
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:58,486
Aha! I think I know why.
Here, see for yourself.

93
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,583
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

94
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,214
‐
<i>‐It's the same day as mine.</i>

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,530
No way! Thanks a lot.

96
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,500
I have a feeling Kayo felt
awkward about telling you.

97
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,739
She's a very shy girl,
you know.

98
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:15,473
I wouldn't make too big a deal out of
it, know what I mean?

99
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,927
Mm‐hmm, you're right.

100
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,074
Well, see you tomorrow.

101
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:21,329
Satoru...

102
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,414
that was a close race.

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,169
Keep on doing your best,
with Kayo too, OK?

104
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:29,566
OK.

105
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,719
<i>Gaku Yashiro.</i>

106
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:33,873
<i>He's around my age here.</i>

107
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,313
<i>And as perceptive</i>
<i>as I remember.</i>

108
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,737
<i>I know when Day X is.</i>

109
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,414
<i>March 1st.</i>

110
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,949
<i>Eleven days from now.</i>

111
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,308
<i>I have to make things right</i>
<i>with Kayo.</i>

112
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,674
Wh‐Where is she?

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,245
Hey, Satoru!

114
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Yuuki!</i>

115
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,792
It looks like you got
yourself some friends, huh?

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,247
Good for you.

117
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,546
<i>In this time, Yuuki's 23,</i>

118
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,157
<i>just a few years younger</i>
<i>than I am.</i>

119
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:36,352
‐It's 'cause of you, Yuuki.
‐Not even.

120
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:39,789
Y‐You just found the courage
you always had in you.

121
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:42,532
Soon as folks saw how fun
you were to be around,

122
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,067
it all f‐fell into place.

123
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,394
<i>Same kind heart, same stutter.</i>

124
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,752
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

125
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,859
Yuuki, do you know
a girl named Kayo?

126
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:57,412
‐Little Kayo? Sure I know her.
<i>‐That was quick.</i>

127
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,535
I see her hanging out
by herself in the park a lot.

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,305
I talked to her
a bunch of times.

129
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:05,071
Is she in your class
or something?

130
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,987
- ‐ Yeah.
- ‐ Oh, no way.

131
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,368
I didn't know that.

132
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,787
Yo, Jun, time to eat!

133
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:12,923
Thanks, Dad.
I'll be there in a bit.

134
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,803
It's kind of early
for dinner.

135
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,993
Yeah, but we
get up early.

136
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:19,830
I start work at my dad's
bento shop at 4 a. m.

137
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,249
Whoa, really!?

138
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,823
- ‐Mm‐hmm. I work from 4 to noon.
- ‐ Oh.

139
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,840
<i>I didn't think he had a job,</i>

140
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,866
<i>'cause every time we hung out,</i>
<i>it was in the afternoon.</i>

141
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:33,401
<i>Now that I'm older, I think</i>
<i>I get why he stuttered.</i>

142
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,912
<i>He was just nervous</i>
<i>and trying to connect with me.</i>

143
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,283
<i>But to a kid, he came off as</i>
<i>really mature and kind of wise.</i>

144
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,167
So, what kinds of stuff
did you two talk about?

145
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,169
Did he ever make you feel nervous
or did you feel safe around him?

146
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,767
There's this neat article on
a paper‐crafting tournament.

147
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,289
I forget which issue, though.

148
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,846
Um...

149
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:57,822
I'm just holding those
for someone

150
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,522
so I can't throw them out.

151
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,068
No, it's cool, I don't care.

152
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,056
About his room.
 Did you see anything that made you uneasy?

153
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:12,381
Oh, it's late.
I better go.

154
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:13,595
OK.

155
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,091
That's weird.

156
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,524
Somehow you seem more mature.

157
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,241
You think so?

158
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,513
Mm‐hmm.

159
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,922
<i>Jun Shiratori.</i>

160
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:31,289
<i>In 2006,</i>

161
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:32,849
<i>he's sitting on death row.</i>

162
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,587
<i>Ever since the first trial,</i>

163
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,247
<i>he said he was innocent.</i>

164
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,578
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he'd kill anyone, not Yuuki.</i>

165
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,836
<i>If the murders don't happen,</i>
<i>he won't be a suspect.</i>

166
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:51,413
<i>Hang on, Yuuki,</i>
<i>I'm gonna change everything.</i>

167
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,428
<i>I guess Kayo's not home yet.</i>

168
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,864
<i>Jeez, what a dump.</i>

169
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,890
<i>Hmm?</i>

170
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,799
<i>What's that?</i>

171
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,555
<i> Her gloves!</i>

172
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,428
<i>Oh, no!</i>

173
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:25,687
Kayo!

174
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,074
Don't look.

175
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,328
Close the door.

176
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,221
What are you talking about?
I'm getting you out of here!

177
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:35,514
Go away!

178
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:43,691
What ya doing in there, Kayo?

179
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,192
What do you keep coming out here
by yourself for?

180
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:50,656
<i>Bitch.</i>
<i>You did this!</i>

181
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,465
Come on, get up.
Get in the house.

182
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,325
Wait! How did Kayo
get those bruises?

183
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:14,263
Go on and answer him, honey.

184
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:19,997
I fell.

185
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,294
<i>She was too scared</i>
<i>to tell the truth.</i>

186
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,875
<i>And I was too shocked</i>
<i>to say anything.</i>

187
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,736
<i>She kept walking</i>
<i>and didn't look back.</i>

188
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,635
<i>Not even once.</i>

189
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:53,981
Come on, let's get
some of that swelling down.

190
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,782
You wanna show up for class
on Monday with a puffy face?

191
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:04,085
No. 'Cause then they're gonna
start asking me questions.

192
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,947
Hey! Don't waste
the goddamn ice.

193
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:29,977
<i>Where is she?</i>

194
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:38,170
‐Morning, Satoru.
‐Good morning.

195
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,398
Morning.

196
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:41,561
Man, it's cold.

197
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,637
If you know
the circumference,

198
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:48,195
divide it by 2 times 3.14
to find the radius.

199
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,732
If you know the diameter,
just divide it by two and that's the radius.

200
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,796
Now then, who...?

201
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:55,615
<i>Thank God.</i>

202
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,450
It's OK, go take your seat.

203
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,036
All right, which one of you wants
to come up and take a crack at this?

204
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,723
‐
‐How about you, Satoru?

205
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:07,566
- ‐ Aww, jeez!
- ‐ Aww, come on.

206
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:08,964
- ‐ You can do it.
- ‐

207
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,758
Has everyone brought up
their money?

208
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,871
<i>I have to change the future.</i>

209
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,423
‐Today's the day, guys.
<i>‐Fast.</i>

210
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,313
If you forgot it,
please bring it tomorrow.

211
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,596
Yes, it is strange how Kayo's always
either tardy or absent on Mondays.

212
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,575
Do you have any idea why?

213
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:35,936
Yeah, I do. It's 'cause
her mom beats her on Saturdays.

214
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,824
So, you've seen the bruises
on her too, huh?

215
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,720
Wait,
you knew about this?

216
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,666
I suspected.

217
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:44,602
Well, then why
didn't you say anything?

218
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,265
I was worried what would happen
if the students found out.

219
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,587
You see how the other kids
avoid her.

220
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,039
If they found out she was
being abused,

221
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,711
they'd tease her and make
her life even more miserable.

222
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,578
They wouldn't do that!

223
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,661
I know you wouldn't.
You're her friend.

224
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:03,791
That's why I'll tell you
everything I know.

225
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,993
‐But keep it between us, OK?
‐Mm‐hmm.

226
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:12,123
I started to suspect Kayo's mother
was abusing her around last May.

227
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,620
I tried going through proper
channels, but it hasn't worked.

228
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,146
Why not?

229
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,565
Her mom's been cleverly
avoiding the investigators.

230
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:24,654
Child Protective Services went to her
house three times to speak with her.

231
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,772
She must have known
they were coming

232
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,445
because her and Kayo
were never home,

233
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,508
so no official interview
has happened yet.

234
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,236
‐What a bunch of useless people.
<i>‐What a bunch of useless people.</i>

235
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,207
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

236
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,448
Yes, well, I've spoken with
Kayo's mom a number of times.

237
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,686
There's no doubt
she's abusing her daughter.

238
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,622
But I have to wait
for CPS to confirm it.

239
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:47,440
When they do,
they'll take Kayo away from her.

240
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,847
<i>He's already got this</i>
<i>figured out.</i>

241
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,248
The thing is, once they
intervene and get her to safety,

242
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,323
it means she won't be
coming back here, ever.

243
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,644
I don't care about that
as long as Kayo's safe.

244
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,080
The sooner, the better.

245
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,142
<i>It's almost March,</i>

246
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:06,286
<i>so there's only a few days left</i>
<i>to save her.</i>

247
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,383
<i>Someone has</i>
<i>to do something now.</i>

248
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,182
I <i>have to do something.</i>

249
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,140
Sit down, will ya?

250
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,594
<i>Holy shit.</i>

251
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,353
<i>Where the hell's</i>
<i>everyone's lunch money?</i>

252
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,838
<i>Oh, you'd think a 29‐year‐old would be
smart enough not to leave cash in his desk.</i>

253
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:28,649
‐ Mr. Yashiro?
‐What's up?

254
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:32,240
It's about the lunch money.
I can't find it.

255
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:34,070
What? Huh?
No! Figures.

256
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,190
Sir, I think I know
what happened.

257
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:39,003
Someone must have stolen it.

258
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,790
And I have a feeling
that someone is Kayo.

259
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,818
What?
How do you know she did?

260
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,330
Who else could it be?

261
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:48,225
I mean, she doesn't have to pay
for her lunches like we do.

262
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,168
It sort of figures the thief
would be someone who's poor.

263
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,106
- ‐ Good point!
- ‐ Did you take it, Kayo?

264
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,158
<i>The brat!</i>

265
00:16:56,985 --> 00:17:00,655
The best way to find out who stole
it is to check everyone's bags.

266
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,825
She's right, teach.
We should check 'em.

267
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,172
I just wanna
eat my lunch.

268
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,003
This sucks.
You gonna check your bag?

269
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,262
No. What's the point?
I already know I didn't take the cash.

270
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,819
Check the bag of the person
next to you, too.

271
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,264
‐You stole it, didn't you?
‐Drop dead.

272
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,148
‐Hurry, find the thief!
‐ I didn't find anything.

273
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:22,217
‐I bet it's Kayo.  ‐I know, right?
‐Poor kid, schmoor kid!

274
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:24,319
Found it.

275
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,707
‐It was Kayo!
‐The poor girl did it.

276
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,575
I told you she took it.
Kayo's a thief and should be expelled.

277
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,028
Shut up! It doesn't matter
if she's poor or hungry!

278
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,714
Kayo would never steal
anything from anyone!

279
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,086
<i>I bet</i> you <i>took the money.</i>

280
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:46,718
You know, anyone could have
taken the cash from Satoru's desk

281
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,274
and planted in Kayo's bag.

282
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,659
All right, guys.
Remember, Kayo was helping collect the money earlier,

283
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,111
so of course she'd have it.

284
00:17:57,246 --> 00:18:01,479
Misato, Satoru, it's over.
OK, everyone, back to lunch.

285
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,262
I knew she didn't
do it.

286
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:06,046
<i>Attention, students,</i>
<i>classes are done for the day</i>

287
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,612
<i>and the school will be</i>
<i>closing soon.</i>

288
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:08,938
<i>This isn't awkward.</i>

289
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,650
Thanks for speaking up
for me before.

290
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:17,335
Oh, sure.
She had no right accusing you.

291
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:19,910
Back in third grade,

292
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,602
Misato made fun of my pencils,

293
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,205
so I took her favorite mechanical
pencil and chucked it out the window.

294
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,476
Since then, she's hated me
like you wouldn't believe,

295
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,368
and I hated her right back.

296
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,457
This other time, she invited me
to a Christmas party at her house,

297
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,724
but that was only to show off
how big her tree was.

298
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,902
It was really pretty, though.

299
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,882
<i>I remember tonight.</i>

300
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,032
Hey, after we're done here,
wanna go see one?

301
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,299
One what?

302
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,101
A Christmas tree.

303
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,238
You're an idiot.

304
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,411
‐Here.
‐Hmm?

305
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,947
You're gonna need 'em.

306
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,686
It gets super cold
up on the mountain.

307
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:14,457
I didn't say I was
going to go with you.

308
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:24,547
I always used to come here
to go skiing and bobsledding.

309
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,053
I'd even see a red fox or two.

310
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:38,809
There they are!

311
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,782
Aren't they cool?

312
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,175
<i>I remembered the foxes</i>
<i>running around and around.</i>

313
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,288
<i>But 18 years ago,</i>
<i>I was by myself,</i>

314
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,492
<i>and no one believed me</i>
<i>when I told them.</i>

315
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,684
Were they a couple?

316
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,611
Mm‐hmm. I bet they were.

317
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:16,301
<i>The sky's clearing up.</i>

318
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,430
<i>It's a perfect night.</i>

319
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,542
There it is.

320
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,221
That's a Christmas tree!

321
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,771
Huh?

322
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:47,226
Don't be dumb, it's February.

323
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:52,351
We should come back
in summer and see it.

324
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,505
Our Christmas tree.

325
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,027
You're an idiot.
