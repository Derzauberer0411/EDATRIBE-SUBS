1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:03,920
I get what you're saying,
but before you came along,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,955
I thought I'd always be alone in life.

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:08,392
And here I am with my very own family.

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,427
You made that possible.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,130
So thank you.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,166
<i>She said "thank you."</i>

7
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,236
<i>but I can't remember what for.</i>

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,208
Uh‐oh, someone’s hungry.

9
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,144
OK, OK.

10
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:39,829
<i>I remember now!</i>

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,426
<i>I saved Kayo's life.</i>

12
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:46,997
<i>After that, I made sure Misato and Aya were never alone,</i>

13
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:49,333
<i>to keep them safe from the kidnapper.</i>

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,201
<i>And then...</i>

15
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,077
Yashiro...

16
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:05,049
I remember everything, you son of a bitch!

17
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,362
No way.
Kazu's a carpenter?

18
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,631
He and Osamu look like they're doing great.

19
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,266
Mm‐hmm.

20
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,923
By the way, Misato said she was
going to come by and see you.

21
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,423
What? Really?

22
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:59,194
I thought she hated my guts after what happened in class.

23
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,763
Yeah, I remember that.

24
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,540
The lunch money thing she pulled was so messed up.

25
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,215
It was, but don't forget who started raising
funds to help pay Satoru's medical bills.

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,750
She did that, too.

27
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,446
I had no idea.

28
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,744
Tell us about the day you tailed her.

29
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:16,731
You know,
when you saw the killer.

30
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,835
Knew it.
You do remember everything.

31
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:26,295
But then why didn't you tell us?

32
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,282
I didn't want to get you involved.

33
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,857
It's been 15 years.

34
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,997
Whatever evidence there was is gone by now.

35
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,942
And besides, who'd believe me?

36
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,479
Like you said,
it's been 15 years.

37
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,841
Now that you're back,
I couldn't be happier,

38
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,010
because it's a miracle you woke up at all.

39
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,612
That's why I didn't bring it up before,

40
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:53,015
to spare you from the shock.

41
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,218
The last thing you need is someone digging up the past

42
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,619
when you're trying to recover.

43
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:00,022
But you remember everything.

44
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:03,377
So, if you want to catch the killer,

45
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,627
you don't have to do it alone.

46
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,595
Let us help you.

47
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:12,230
Hiromi's been coming here to visit you all these years,

48
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,008
and now he wants to be a doctor.

49
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,713
I became a lawyer,

50
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:18,841
and now I'm working with Mr. Sawada to catch the killer.

51
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,678
Hiromi and I are who we are because of you, Satoru.

52
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,578
You were a hero to us back then.

53
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,250
and we want to help you again,
just like old times.

54
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,886
Just like we helped with Kayo.

55
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:35,138
You trusted me enough back then,
believed in me, you remember?

56
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,085
That's why I believed in you.

57
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:42,840
If someone believes in you,
you're not alone.

58
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,632
And if I was in your situation,

59
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,310
I'd want someone to believe me.

60
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,104
<i>Airi.</i>

61
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,809
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,785
<i>I have friends I can count on.</i>

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,310
The killer is...

64
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,169
Yashiro.

65
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,354
I knew you remembered.

66
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,817
On the way up here,

67
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,639
I tapped my finger on
your wheelchair a couple times.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,791
I could tell you tried hard not to react.

69
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,678
Fifteen years ago,

70
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,634
you figured out what I was doing and ruined my plans.

71
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,208
But how?

72
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,983
A child isn't capable of such tings.

73
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,694
It's as if you were psychic or something.

74
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:49,757
Yashiro!
I know your future!

75
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:56,034
Let's have it. How did you know what I was thinking?

76
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:59,299
What did you mean,
you know my future?

77
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,810
What difference does it make?

78
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,923
Soon as I tell you,
you'll kill me.

79
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh, I know what you're up to.

80
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:11,153
You’ve got a phone in your pocket.
Are you recording us?

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,386
Or is someone listening in?

82
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:15,121
Kenya, perhaps?

83
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,563
You have heard of the statute of limitations?

84
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:36,901
Even if I confessed, 
I can't be tried for things I did 15 years ago.

85
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,659
And I haven't done anything wrong since then.

86
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:45,522
So you see, no matter what you do, 
you can never get me, Satoru.

87
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:49,653
Oh, look, Kumi just sent you an email.

88
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,467
At 4:30, she'll get her daily IV.

89
00:06:55,362 --> 00:07:01,111
I put a muscle relaxant in her dose and made
sure your fingerprints were all over the bag.

90
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,550
That poor little girl who was afraid of her operation

91
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,777
will die peacefully now thanks to you.

92
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:11,668
And feeling guilty, 
I throw myself off the roof, isn't that right?

93
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,541
There you go reading my mind again.

94
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,691
While that might be an amazing skill, 
it won't save your life.

95
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,936
But you might save Kumi's if
you tell me what I want to know.

96
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,235
If I do, then what?
How do I know you won't kill her anyway?

97
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,790
I can't guarantee I won't, naturally.

98
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:34,153
But there is a possibility.

99
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:37,486
If you don't talk,
there won't even be that.

100
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,812
I hate to say it.
We're out of time now.

101
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,679
There was a 50‐50 chance you'd tell me

102
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,595
how you knew about me back then.

103
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,439
Oh, well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

104
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:56,683
I'm sure it was just a coincidence
when you screamed you knew my future.

105
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,301
That was just a bluff.

106
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,925
As for your mother...

107
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,389
we should send her an email,
let her know how sorry you are.

108
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,528
Hey, kiddo, I have to work the morning shift tomorrow,

109
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,562
so I'll see you in the afternoon?

110
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:17,100
I'll let him sleep.

111
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:20,687
Mom?

112
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,773
I lied to you.
I got my‐‐

113
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,039
Your memory back?

114
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,431
I know.
It happened when Kayo came by.

115
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:31,974
<i>Yep, she's a witch.</i>

116
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,148
You're right, 
but how come you didn't tell <i>her</i> not to bring up the past?

117
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,436
After Kenya and Hiromi stopped by,

118
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,235
I felt I made a mistake

119
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,357
telling them not to bring any of it up.

120
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,244
They couldn't say what they wanted, and that wasn't fair.

121
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,642
When Kayo showed up with her baby,

122
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,302
I didn't have the heart to ask her to do the same.

123
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,749
After waiting all this time for you to wake up,
 who am I to stop her?

124
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:04,927
I got to see your face and talk to
you every day for the last 15 years.

125
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:08,499
Then when I heard you speak,
your voice all crackly,

126
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:12,049
it finally hit me,
you weren't a kid anymore.

127
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,550
I was happy...

128
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,426
My boy grew up.

129
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:25,475
Mom, I'm gonna take life head‐on.

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,709
What in the heck are you talking about?

131
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,761
Even when you were a little kid,

132
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:33,118
you always took it head‐on,
remember?

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,028
Mm‐hmm.

134
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:43,707
Life is about filling up the void in yourself.

135
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:44,943
Indeed.

136
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:48,071
Whenever I taught sixth grade,
I always told the class that.

137
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,645
I remember what your face looked like.

138
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,078
The day they took Kayo from her mom.

139
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:57,700
The expression you had stuck with
me even after all these years.

140
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,770
A little while after I was born,
my dad took off.

141
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,331
So I have no idea what he looks like.

142
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:11,501
But that day at Kayo's,
you were the dad I never had and I always wanted.

143
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:15,972
At that moment,
you filled the void in me.

144
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:25,484
For the last 15 years,
I've been waiting for you to wake up.

145
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:30,815
When you slipped into your coma,
I lost the impulse that defined me,

146
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,797
the thing that gave my life meaning.

147
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:37,349
I've waited a long time.
But now...

148
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,201
You're not alone anymore?

149
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,734
So, how are we gonna settle this?

150
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,581
Are you gonna turn yourself in or kill me?

151
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,052
Which is it?

152
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:50,921
It's already settled, actually.

153
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,985
You're right, I beat you.

154
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,547
I saved all of them from you.

155
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:00,585
Kayo, Aya, Hiromi, Yuuki.

156
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,106
Even my mom,
who you haven't killed yet.

157
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,979
Your mom?
Why would I kill...

158
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:11,237
Hold on, are you saying you can I'm just
telling you what you wanted to know.

159
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,671
I could screw up all your plans
because I knew your future.

160
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:17,021
That's it.

161
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,132
That's how I saved them all.

162
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:24,712
That's why you weren't able to kill
anyone I was even remotely connected to.

163
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,723
Why you couldn't kill me.

164
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,113
Wrong.

165
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,394
I could have killed you anytime I wanted.

166
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,270
Now, for instance.

167
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,962
But for 15 years,
you let me live.

168
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,367
Why did you do that?

169
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,991
Oh, I know,
you needed me, didn't you?

170
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,510
I was your reason for living.

171
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,416
I was your hope.

172
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,276
I was the one who filled the void in you.

173
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,611
I beat you back then,
Mr. Yashiro...

174
00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:00,062
No! No! No!

175
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,745
Even now, I beat you!

176
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:29,254
You see what I mean?
You can't kill me.

177
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,411
Fifteen years is a long time.

178
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:40,284
I was asleep, so for me it all went by in a flash,

179
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,443
but for you, it must have felt like forever.

180
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:15,452
You're still alive 'cause I'm around.

181
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:18,805
I make you feel alive.

182
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:26,610
I had to relive a part of my life over and over again,

183
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,285
the part where you killed some of my friends.

184
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:33,535
Funny, I should hate you, but I don't.

185
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:37,484
'Cause right now, I'm the only one who knows you.

186
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:39,947
The real you.

187
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,230
You're right.

188
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,016
Satoru.

189
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,910
I can't live...

190
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:08,183
You're right.

191
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,593
I can't go on living without you.

192
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:03,808
The police are charging him with attempted murder.

193
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,182
Is Kumi OK?

194
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,731
Yeah, but I didn't tell her about him,

195
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,001
what with her surgery coming up and all.

196
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:12,091
Good.

197
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:15,705
"I believe in you."
What a strange thing to say.

198
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:17,774
- ‐Huh?
- ‐ Well, think about it.

199
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:21,478
If you really believe in someone,
chances are, they already know you do.

200
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:24,148
Saying it's kind of redundant,
don't you think?

201
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:27,662
Not if you mean it,
and you want someone to know you do.

202
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,008
Yeah.

203
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,534
I guess we say it 'cause we
want to give someone hope.

204
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,826
Hope to keep fighting.

205
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,863
To let them know they're not alone in the world, right?

206
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:54,261
<i>Now my life has a blank spot
between the ages of 11 and 25.</i>

207
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,608
<i>But in a weird way,
I sort of treasure the time I lost.</i>

208
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:05,321
<i>In a town without me,</i>
<i>my friends lived for themselves</i>

209
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:06,639
<i>and for me.</i>

210
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,122
 Where is he?

211
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,946
Heroes always show up at the last minute.

212
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,775
‐Right? ‐Here's Satoru.
‐About time.

213
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,594
‐Where you been? ‐What's up, dude?
‐You're an idiot.

214
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,104
Are you ever on time?

215
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,612
<i>A town without me.</i>

216
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,614
<i>Time without me.</i>

217
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,456
<i>It's not my loss,</i>
<i>it's my treasure.</i>

218
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,424
Whoa!

219
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:35,865
This is great!

220
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,247
Whenever you dig deep,

221
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,544
you always come up with the most amazing angles.

222
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,292
Thanks. I guess I'll keep working on it, then.

223
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:46,248
That‐a‐boy. And sorry you had to schlep out here.

224
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,355
So, you heading out today?

225
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,098
Yep. Going back to Hokkaido for a break.

226
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,655
There's some old friends I wanna see.

227
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,879
Well, have yourself a great time, then.

228
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,777
Safe travels and have a good weekend.

229
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,274
Oh, almost forgot.

230
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,901
Congrats on your anime getting the green light.

231
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,267
<i>I write and draw manga for a living now.</i>

232
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,348
<i>As for Revival,</i>
<i>I haven't had another.</i>

233
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:48,235
<i>The 2010 Olympics in Vancouver
are just two short weeks away.</i>

234
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,921
<i>The athletes representing Japan are already...</i>

235
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:00,200
‐I'm gonna go out for a walk.
‐We'll hold the fort down.

236
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:01,817
Later, boss.

237
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:06,076
Oh, I heard we'll be getting some more
snow later on, so take a jacket...

238
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,927
<i>"My Hero,"</i>
<i>by Satoru Fujinuma.</i>

239
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:48,201
<i>"I'm not brave enough</i>
<i>to make the first move...</i>

240
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,702
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I don't have any real friends.</i>

241
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:56,939
<i>I play with other kids, but there's a difference
between playing with them and real friends.</i>

242
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:01,809
<i>Yesterday, I saw the last episode of 'Fight, Wonder Guy!',</i>

243
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,178
<i>my favorite anime.</i>

244
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:05,774
<i>In the first part of it,</i>

245
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,674
<i>Wonder Guy had to fight the bad guys by himself.</i>

246
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,762
<i>They'd knock him down again and again,</i>

247
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>but he had the courage to get back up.</i>

248
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:19,248
<i>He'd say, "If I don't try, nothing will change,"</i>

249
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,227
<i>and he'd jump right back into the fight.</i>

250
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:27,837
<i>Other people saw how courageous he was and slowly
but surely, they joined him and became his friends.</i>

251
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,724
<i>When it looked like the bad guy was gonna
finish him off for good, he didn't worry.</i>

252
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,624
<i>He never stopped believing that his
friends would come to the rescue.</i>

253
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:41,453
<i>But someone like me doesn't have
Wonder Guy's courage or real friends.</i>

254
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,081
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I feel kind of jealous.</i>

255
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,373
<i>I want friends</i>
<i>like his someday.</i>

256
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:51,394
<i>Real friends, the kind that have my back no matter what."</i>

257
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,887
Can you believe this snow?

258
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:14,149
The Weather Channel said it's the most
snow Kanto's gotten in ten years! Ten!

259
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:27,337
Mind if I hang out here with you till it stops?

260
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:44,498
<i>I never stopped believing either.</i>
