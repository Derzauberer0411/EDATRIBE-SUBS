1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,359
Congratulations,
everyone.

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:09,236
<i>In 1988, the first time I lived it,</i>

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:12,817
<i>Kayo Hinazuki and Aya Nakanishi disappeared</i>

4
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:14,736
<i>and their bodies were found later.</i>

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,785
<i>I was too helpless to save anyone.</i>

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,944
<i>I tried hard to forget, and I did.</i>

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,157
<i>But in the end, I had a big gaping hole in my heart.</i>

8
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,978
These past six years,
we've experienced success and failure,

9
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,660
happiness and sadness.

10
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:41,029
Good or bad, the experiences we share
fill a void we all have inside of us.

11
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,728
Everyone. Even me.

12
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:47,869
So keep filling it,
and you'll enrich your life, and others' too.

13
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:50,915
That’s what life's about. Never forget that.

14
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:31,966
Uh, hey there.

15
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,754
Who are you?

16
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,788
- ‐ I'm Satoru Fujinuma.
- ‐ I'm Kenya Kobayashi.

17
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:40,558
‐ I'm Hiromi Sugita.

18
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,198
Have we met before?

19
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,140
Uh, you're Aya Nakanishi.

20
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,832
I heard you're good at piano.

21
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,796
Yeah, I guess.

22
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,357
So, did we meet in piano class?

23
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,905
Well, actually, no.

24
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,779
So, anyway, what you reading?

25
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,557
Oh, this? Shakespeare.

26
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:01,781
"King Lear." I've only read "Romeo and Juliet."

27
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,288
Reading this stuff and playing piano are my parents' idea.

28
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,855
I can't hear what they're talking about.

29
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,255
Maybe we should try and get a little closer.

30
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:14,088
Wait, now I remember where I've seen you before.

31
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:17,355
You're the kids who are always
sneaking into that old building.

32
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,822
Aren't you?

33
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:22,471
Darn it. So much for having a secret hideout.

34
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,400
Hideout? That's so childish.

35
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:29,388
‐ You...
‐You shouldn't call it childish.

36
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:32,232
Yeah, well, the only ones who sneak around building forts

37
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:34,117
and secret hideouts are little boys.

38
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:36,688
I bet you like playing superhero too.

39
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,420
Don't make fun of superheroes!

40
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,344
-Easy, Satoru!
-Nice meeting you, but I have to go now.

41
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,353
Bye, kids.

42
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:48,722
Hold up!

43
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,891
Kazu?!

44
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,599
‐What do you want?
‐A hideout...

45
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,147
is totally macho!

46
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,288
Uh...

47
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,488
You should come and see it sometime.

48
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,025
You'll get what I mean.

49
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:08,651
You're a bunch of weirdoes!

50
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,659
She’s childish.

51
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,150
You were so rad yesterday!

52
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:20,868
<i>It's my gloves,</i>

53
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,595
<i>right where I left them 18 years ago.</i>

54
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:27,842
‐Leveling up's a pain in the nuts.
‐That's what makes games fun.

55
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,724
Hey, Satoru,
Aya's gonna be at the park soon,

56
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,542
so maybe we should start heading over.

57
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,250
It's cool.
I can see the bench from here.

58
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,295
OK.

59
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,566
<i>Yesterday was a wash.</i>

60
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,123
<i>I gotta figure out how to get close to her.</i>

61
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:50,069
All right, I'm here to see this macho hideout of yours.

62
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,730
Um... thanks for coming, Aya.
Can you stay awhile?

63
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,877
Mm‐hmm.

64
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,674
- See you.
- Bye‐bye.

65
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:07,302
You off to see Aya again?

66
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,278
Yep. We'll cruise by the hideout later.

67
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:12,582
Well, guys, see you then!

68
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,346
‐Later days, teach!
‐"Goodbye" is more proper.

69
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,288
I can't picture Aya and Kazu liking each other.

70
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,255
Yeah, me neither, but the good thing is,

71
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,053
she's always got someone with her now.

72
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,125
Mm‐hmm.

73
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:29,588
Um, you guys, I... I just wanted to say thank you.

74
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:30,697
Why?

75
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,921
I think it's awesome how you're going
around making sure none of us are alone.

76
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:36,796
Both of my parents work,

77
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,838
and nothing felt worse than me getting
home and the house being empty.

78
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:46,267
It's pretty awesome how you kept Kayo and
Aya and me from being alone all the time.

79
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,436
So thank you.

80
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,921
Hey, guys! We going to the hideout or what?
I'm getting tired of waiting.

81
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:59,603
- ‐What's up? Where's Kazu?
- ‐ He went to go meet Aya.

82
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,877
‐How come?
‐You're joking, right?

83
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,417
It's not like she doesn't know where our hideout is.

84
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,322
Maybe you should talk to him.

85
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,988
Oh, whatever.
Let's get going, already!

86
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,388
OK.

87
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,688
Goodbye, Mr. Yashiro.

88
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,200
‐ Slow pokes
‐ What's the rush?

89
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,613
Wait up, guys!

90
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,563
<i>Aya Nakanishi,</i>

91
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,690
<i>Hiromi Sugita,</i>

92
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,688
<i>and Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

93
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>They're all still alive,</i>

94
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:37,551
<i>so I guess that means the killer gave up on them.</i>

95
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,648
<i>But now that the clues from the bus are gone,</i>

96
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,364
<i>how am I gonna find him?</i>

97
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,023
There. Now he really looks like a girl.

98
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,455
Whoa!

99
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:51,171
Now what? Are you done?
You know, playing detective.

100
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,119
Not yet.
I'm still on the case.

101
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>In 2006, my mom told Sawada she
thought she knew who the killer was.</i>

102
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,518
<i>It's possible it's someone she knows now, in 1988.</i>

103
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:11,504
<i>Maybe like Mr. Yashiro and his candy,</i>

104
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,370
<i>the killer needs, a substitute, too,</i>

105
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,620
<i>someone to take the place of the kids that got away.</i>

106
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,808
Move it.

107
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,636
Well, me and Kenya are heading out
now to go watch the hockey game.

108
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,770
‐Is Hamada playing?
‐You know it.

109
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,036
Wish I could go. When you see
him, tell him I said good luck.

110
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,135
‐Sure.
‐See ya later.

111
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:46,450
Here I am.

112
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:51,436
You notice how Misato's been keeping to herself lately?

113
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,836
No. Really?

114
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,270
Yeah.
People have been avoiding her,

115
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,835
ever since that lunch money thing happened.

116
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:02,362
Oh, man. I guess I could try talking to her on Monday.

117
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:03,603
Cool.

118
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,220
Thanks for breakfast!

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,667
Oh, yeah,
I might be a little late today.

120
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,467
Not too late, I hope.
When you know what time,

121
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,433
how about you call and let me know, OK?

122
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,458
Mm‐hmm, I will.
See ya later, Mom!

123
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,850
Have a good day today, Satoru.

124
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:37,198
‐ Mr. Yashiro's gonna take us.
‐ Really?

125
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,729
You know who will have to walk over there.

126
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,600
‐ Too bad for her.
‐ <i>What can I say to her?</i>

127
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,575
Crap! Missed her.

128
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:01,895
Satoru, I heard you're gonna try helping Misato next.

129
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,787
Mm‐hmm, but she just left.

130
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,558
I bet she's going to Wakaba Gym.

131
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,367
‐Really?
‐Yeah, Hamada's playing,

132
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,333
so Mr. Yashiro invited her to go cheer him on.

133
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,333
You know what,
she went to last week's game alone, too.

134
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,233
‐Thanks.
‐Want us to go with you?

135
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:22,100
Nah, I think I better do this myself.
It's no biggie.

136
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,933
OK, but I want a full report tomorrow.

137
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,600
Got it, Detective Satoru?

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,933
Sure.

139
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,167
We'll be at the hideout if you need backup.

140
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,267
- ‐Mm‐hmm. See you later!
- ‐ Later, dude!

141
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,933
- ‐ See you tomorrow!
- ‐ You got it.

142
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,433
‐ Bye! ‐ See ya!
‐ Bye, you guys!

143
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,700
Saying bye's a big deal with him.

144
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,982
I know, right?
He acts like he'll never see us again.

145
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:50,292
Whoa! It's even colder in here than outside.

146
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,092
Ohhh! Hamada!

147
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,326
Show 'em who's boss out there.

148
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,559
I can't concentrate with you uglies yellin'!

149
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,559
‐Ah, we can yell if we want.
‐Watch the attitude, Kouichi.

150
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,726
‐Otherwise, no dinner for you.
‐What? But they're bugging <i>me!</i>

151
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:13,092
<i>There she is.</i>

152
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,059
<i>And she's alone.</i>

153
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,159
-All right, guys, warm up and get your game face on.
- Yes, sir!

154
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:23,989
<i>Now the killer's lost two more potential victims,
it makes sense he'd go for her next.</i>

155
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,874
<i>She's a perfect target.</i>

156
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,483
<i>She's going to the bathroom.</i>

157
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,920
Game starts in five!

158
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,319
You got it, coach!

159
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:41,756
<i>Why is she taking so long?</i>

160
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:53,952
I needed a candy break. What's wrong?

161
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,752
The game's about to start.

162
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,386
Are you standing guard for someone?

163
00:10:57,386 --> 00:11:00,246
Huh? Oh, uh... no.

164
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:02,574
I just wanted to talk to Misato.

165
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,333
Misato. Hmm...

166
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:08,383
Huh.

167
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:12,387
‐What, did she go outside?
‐Uh‐huh.

168
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,219
<i>Where did she take off to?</i>

169
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,888
<i>That's Yuuki's dad's truck.</i>

170
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,997
Mr. Yashiro,
I need to follow someone.

171
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,900
- ‐Will you drive?
- ‐ Hmm.

172
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,917
That doesn't even sound legal.

173
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,231
It's nothing bad.
We're just playing detective.

174
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,673
We pretend there's a kidnapper at large.

175
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:42,580
Then we try to find girls who seem like they're lonely

176
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:43,879
and make friends with them.

177
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,608
If anything, we could end up stopping a real kidnapping.

178
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:51,501
My God, it might be just a game, but it's a good idea.

179
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,403
I'm glad you think so.

180
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:57,245
Satoru, better buckle up.

181
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,281
Oh.

182
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh, yeah.
I have to get that fixed.

183
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:07,930
There.

184
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:16,106
So, you've noticed Misato's
been keeping to herself lately.

185
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,333
Actually, Hiromi told me a little while ago.

186
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:23,889
Well, if you ask me,
it's great you're being so proactive about it.

187
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,414
I don't know about that.

188
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,582
I couldn't get up the nerve to talk to her before,

189
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:32,129
and, well, I started thinking
she might make good bait.

190
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,189
Really? Bait.

191
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,233
So you're out to catch someone.

192
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:41,007
Now I know why you were working so
hard to be friendly and outgoing.

193
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,632
You’re a man on a mission.

194
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:46,692
Mm‐hmm. Everybody has something that's
missing from their lives, even me.

195
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:48,555
If I can fill that void...

196
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,163
<i>Crap.</i>
<i>I just fed him his own line.</i>

197
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,752
You and I have a lot in common.

198
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:00,719
That happens to be my philosophy in life.

199
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,919
When I teach a sixth‐grade class,

200
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,719
I like to bring it up in my graduation speech.

201
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,944
It sort of ties into what you said,

202
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,735
about using Misato as bait?

203
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:13,819
I can tell you regret it,
but in my opinion, you shouldn't.

204
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,361
There's no difference between
a good deed and a bad one.

205
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:22,886
They both have a similar goal,
to satisfy a need within a person.

206
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,052
<i>Well, that's... extreme.</i>

207
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:30,025
For example, lately I've tried all kinds
of things to get closer to someone.

208
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,283
Sometimes I'm direct,
other times I play coy.

209
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:36,141
At times,
I've even been deceitful.

210
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:39,319
And boy, it's been fun.

211
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,152
With who? A girlfriend?

212
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:45,152
I can see how you'd make that connection.

213
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:49,975
Hmm. Either way,
it's about filling some kind of emptiness.

214
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:54,083
Um... want a lollipop?

215
00:13:56,696 --> 00:14:01,063
Thank you for asking,
but I'm afraid you won't find any there.

216
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:08,325
You see, this isn't my car.

217
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,402
Where is your car then? In the shop?

218
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,702
Whatever your happiest moment is today,

219
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:30,069
another will eventually come along to replace it.

220
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,302
And thanks to you, mine just got replaced.

221
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,936
Nothing compares to the feeling a person gets

222
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,336
when they can finally satisfy their need.

223
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,369
You spent all this time searching,

224
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,736
and when you get it, it's like heaven.

225
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:44,536
You know, it's true what they say,

226
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,602
the more effort something takes,
the sweeter the reward is.

227
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:51,902
<i>Where the hell is he going with this?</i>

228
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:53,336
<i>Laxatives?</i>

229
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:56,816
Satoru. You lied to me a few minutes ago.

230
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,604
You said you're just pretending there's a kidnapper,

231
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:02,062
but the truth is, you know there's one,

232
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,477
and you're trying to catch him.

233
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,236
I've resisted the idea for a while now

234
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,327
because I couldn't believe it was possible.

235
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:12,030
Well, more like I didn't want to believe...

236
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,348
the possibility that someone
was anticipating my every move.

237
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,060
If you're still worried about Misato, don't be.

238
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,136
The only person in that truck is Jun Shiratori's father.

239
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,402
I realized something was up with you the
day I saw you following Aya Nakanishi.

240
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,575
And I was planning to kidnap her

241
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,022
the day I gave you and your mom a ride.

242
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,879
Looking back, it's kind of funny.

243
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,610
I mean, there you were trying to snatch my prey

244
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:57,602
and I was the one telling you how to do it.

245
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,236
That was the second time you ruined my plans,

246
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,612
and I started to suspect it was more than a coincidence.

247
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,263
I knew Misato's friends were shunning her,

248
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:10,102
so I asked her to the hockey game.

249
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,569
Then I told Hiromi about it.

250
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:16,369
If you showed up,
my suspicions were correct,

251
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:20,002
that you...
you were my enemy.

252
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,869
<i>No way.</i>

253
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,936
When the time was right,
I gave Misato a drink

254
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:26,702
laced with that laxative you found.

255
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,069
And I bought dinner,
to place Shiratori at the scene.

256
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:33,402
<i>No. No!</i>

257
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:38,081
Yes, sir, all the pieces fit together as planned.

258
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,942
And in the end,
I'm not who you thought I was.

259
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,636
Oh, and about the car,
I borrowed this one earlier.

260
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,236
I was looking for something specific for today.

261
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,142
Generic model, generic paint job.

262
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,193
A car that's so ubiquitous, no one would even miss it.

263
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:59,501
You know, this is the first time
I've put that theory into practice.

264
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:02,202
<i>How could I be so stupid?!</i>

265
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,736
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

266
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:14,602
Thanks to you, Kayo's alive.

267
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:17,302
<i>I just couldn't accept the possibility.</i>

268
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,617
<i>Yashiro was on one of Sawada's lists of suspects.</i>

269
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,739
<i>But my mom's name was right there with his,</i>

270
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:27,487
<i>so I figured the list was bullshit and blew it off.</i>

271
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:33,848
<i>I trusted him so much, I couldn't even think
of him as a suspect, let alone the killer.</i>

272
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,634
<i>But...</i>

273
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,301
<i>he is.</i>

274
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,956
<i>And now he's got me right where he wants me.</i>

275
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,568
It started snowing.

276
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,664
Don't.
It's stuck for good.

277
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,563
The game's over.

278
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,655
For you and me.

279
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,843
You know,
I still can't believe it.

280
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:46,111
You anticipated all my plans
and destroyed them one by one.

281
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,878
I'm stunned how easily you caught me,
 a little boy like you.

282
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:56,800
It's almost like you can see the future or something.

283
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,450
I want to make sure you understand why you have to die.

284
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,851
Yes, you ruined my plans,

285
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,969
but this has nothing to do with revenge.

286
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,496
Believe me, I do respect you.

287
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,791
But if I can't satisfy my needs the usual way,

288
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,422
I have to find an alternative.

289
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,213
You don't have to do this.
You said the game was over!

290
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:27,355
The children of this town are safe thanks to you, Satoru.

291
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,091
So congratulations, you got what you wanted.

292
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,654
And as for what I wanted, I still get to
kill someone for my sake and on my terms.

293
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,851
Yashiro, I'm not gonna die until I
see you hang for what you've done!

294
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:42,561
Yes, well,
keep telling yourself that.

295
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,229
Yashiro!
You son of a bitch!

296
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,260
I'll get you for this!

297
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:58,812
I wish I could stay, but I have so much packing to do.

298
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:04,299
Yashiro!

299
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:07,724
I know your future!

300
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,861
<i>Shit.</i>

301
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,998
<i>It's cold.</i>

302
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:18,411
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

303
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,759
<i>Going numb...</i>

304
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,130
Shit...

305
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,177
Mom?

306
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,011
What's up, kiddo?

307
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,905
<i>I looked up, our eyes met...</i>

308
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,444
<i>My friends...</i>

309
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:55,677
Hi, Satoru!

310
00:20:57,377 --> 00:20:59,744
Thank you, Satoru.

311
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,190
<i>Kayo.</i>

312
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,162
<i>Airi.</i>
