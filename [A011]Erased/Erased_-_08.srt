1
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>Is that Satoru?</i>

2
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>No, it's not.</i>

3
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,184
<i>Who is that?</i>

4
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,625
You're up.

5
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,994
Good morning.

6
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,662
Why did you get up so early?

7
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:50,198
Isn't it obvious?

8
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,833
I'm making breakfast.

9
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,269
You are heading off to school early again, aren't you?

10
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,504
Yeah.

11
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,515
It looks good.

12
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:04,049
Slow down, kiddo. You'll make yourself sick.

13
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:08,082
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

14
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,483
Mm‐hmm.

15
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,328
Who are you meeting this early in the morning?

16
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,674
Can't tell.

17
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,239
You're not doing anything bad, are you?

18
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,054
Course not.

19
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,753
OK, then.

20
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,524
- ‐See you later, Mom.
- ‐ Hold it.

21
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:31,705
Take this, too.
It's a little something extra.

22
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,442
You know, if you get hungry before lunch.

23
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,536
Right.

24
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,624
Thanks a bunch, Mom.

25
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,863
It's me. Morning.

26
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,567
Good morning, Satoru.

27
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,076
I brought you some breakfast.

28
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,665
Thanks, but did you eat anything yet?

29
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,570
Yep. This is all yours.

30
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,994
Wow! It looks yummy.

31
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:11,491
How are you doing?

32
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:15,291
You must be bored.
Too bad this place doesn't have a TV.

33
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,807
It's OK.
I'm not as bored as you think.

34
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,978
Hiromi brought a ton of books yesterday.

35
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,525
That's good. 
Think you can hold out for another couple days?

36
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,719
Mm‐hmm.

37
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:30,732
That was so good.

38
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,736
‐See ya later.
‐Mm‐hmm.

39
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:57,891
<i>Crap! School's about to start at Izumi Elementary.</i>

40
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,618
<i>I was at the bus for too long.</i>

41
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,035
This grad ceremony's
gonna suck.

42
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,929
I have to give the speech.

43
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,411
Please, you'll be great.

44
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,472
Oh, you're better at giving speeches than me, Aya.

45
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,410
Not even, Saki. It'll be fine, you'll see.

46
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,160
Just have a little courage.

47
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,895
I guess Kayo's absent... again.

48
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,285
You're her friend.
Do you know what's up with her?

49
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,152
No. 
No one was home when I went by there.

50
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:35,280
Where is she? I mean, 
if she was sick, we would have heard.

51
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,875
Yeah, but there's been no word yet, from her mom, anyway.

52
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,162
I'm starting to get a bad feeling, real bad.

53
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:49,645
Come on, I'm sure she'll show up
sooner or later like she always does.

54
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,306
So how about we get started?

55
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,496
Really?

56
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,026
No one was there this morning either, huh?

57
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,425
Are you worried?

58
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:00,832
Mm‐hmm.

59
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,325
You don't look like you're all that worried.

60
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,401
I'm just trying to stay calm.

61
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,049
‐Like you always say, panicking never helps anyone. 
‐You're right.

62
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:14,221
I tried calling Kayo's yesterday and today, 
but there's no answer.

63
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:17,597
Also, I tried calling the place where her mother works.

64
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,179
They told me she hasn't been in.

65
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:23,491
Well, then call the CPS people or the police!

66
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,062
The police, huh? I don't know.

67
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:29,835
I'd hate to open a can of worms,
for someone else, that is.

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,493
I called CPS yesterday, though.
They'll visit her house today.

69
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,593
And I'm going to meet them.

70
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,090
I'm pretty sure if we all show up there,
we'll get to the bottom of things.

71
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,368
It's like I always say in class:
where there's a will, there's a way.

72
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,525
You're the best!

73
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:56,348
<i>All right. Yashiro was on it.</i>

74
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,790
Ms. Hinazuki, we're with Child Protective Services.

75
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,155
Is she even home?

76
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:10,371
Well, all the lights are on, so someone has to be.

77
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:12,530
Why don't we have a look around the back?

78
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,545
Ms. Hinazuki
are you home?

79
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,062
Kayo?

80
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:26,074
- ‐I'm coming in.
-  ‐ You can't just walk in!

81
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,813
Don't worry. 
If anyone complains, I'll take the blame.

82
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:33,254
The girl's been missing for three days now.
It's worth a shot.

83
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,932
A stove and the lights are on.

84
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,379
There’s a half‐eaten dinner on the coffee table.

85
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,272
I don't see Kayo's coat anywhere.

86
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:56,065
By the looks of it,
her mom was just here a minute ago.

87
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,302
She left in a hurry.

88
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,116
I bet she saw us pull up.

89
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,766
By the time we got to the door, she was out the back.

90
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:05,588
Damn it, I was hoping we could
take custody of the girl tonight.

91
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,917
Look, her mother can't stay out in this cold all night.

92
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,294
As soon as we leave,
I'm sure she'll come back.

93
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,978
We can try again tomorrow morning.

94
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,689
I'm worried about Kayo's safety, though.

95
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,827
We could get the police to
put an APB out on the mom.

96
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:22,175
Huh‐uh.
I have a feeling Kayo's safe.

97
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,698
In fact,
I'm positive she is.

98
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,881
OK, we'll take your word for it.

99
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:30,237
We'll leave for now,
give the mother a chance to calm down.

100
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,730
Mr. Yashiro and Child Protective
Services were just at your house.

101
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,800
They were looking for your mom,
but she wasn't there.

102
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:41,675
By tomorrow,
all of this might be over.

103
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,353
Kayo, they said they'd take you away from her.

104
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,621
That's OK.
I'd be way happier without her.

105
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,966
<i>We knew if they took her away from her mom,</i>

106
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,214
<i>they'd be taking her away from us, too.</i>

107
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,860
It'll be hard to go,
but I'll be fine.

108
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,110
Whenever I think of you guys,

109
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,007
I'll remember all the fun we had.

110
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,854
Satoru, I know it's a little late, but...

111
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:09,793
I finished your birthday present.

112
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:11,533
Here you go.

113
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:18,017
<i>I'll give you your present tomorrow, promise.</i>

114
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,364
Thank you.

115
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,803
<i>It feels like...</i>

116
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,520
<i>I don't know.</i>

117
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:38,474
<i>Like I've been waiting for this forever.</i>

118
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,730
It doesn't take much to make you tear up, huh?

119
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,537
Wh‐What?

120
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,651
Oh, hey, Satoru?
Can you spend the night?

121
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:53,078
That’s totally gutsy!

122
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:54,856
Dorks.

123
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,553
Last night someone came in while I was sleeping.

124
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,527
He just walked in.

125
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,635
I don't think he knew I was here.

126
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,849
But it scared me.

127
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:07,542
Maybe it was a security guard or a janitor.

128
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,182
It could have been anyone.

129
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:13,209
Some pervy kid stashing his porn, who knows?

130
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:14,854
It was a grown‐up.

131
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:18,910
Whoever it was was mad.
He kicked that box super hard.

132
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:20,950
Let's open it.

133
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,285
I hope it's nothing worse than porn.

134
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,049
What's that for?

135
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,983
<i>I knew.</i>

136
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:45,125
<i>I knew right away what all that stuff was for.</i>

137
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,303
<i>Then it hit me. This old bus we were
in was out behind Izumi Elementary,</i>

138
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:56,047
<i>the school where I and Nakanishi,
the killer's next victim, went.</i>

139
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,216
<i>We hadn't escaped the loop of kidnappings and murders yet.</i>

140
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,570
<i>March the 2nd.</i>

141
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,475
<i>Sometime after 10 that night,</i>

142
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,620
<i>Kayo disappeared from the shed behind her house.</i>

143
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,100
<i>Tracks found around the shed
were from a pair of rubber boots.</i>

144
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,324
<i>They matched a pair Yuuki owned.</i>

145
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,526
<i>The killer put Kayo in a walk‐in
freezer and sprayed water on her,</i>

146
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:30,822
<i>to make her freeze to death faster.</i>

147
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:36,375
<i>Then the killer took her body</i>
<i>back to the shed before dawn.</i>

148
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,679
<i>We can't stay here.</i>

149
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,672
<i>This bus is at the center of the killer's routine.</i>

150
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,950
It's not safe here.

151
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,576
No. No, it's not.

152
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,548
Our plan was to have someone find Kayo here,

153
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,535
but now, after seeing this crap,
we'd better move her.

154
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,854
Mm‐hmm. We don't want some creep to find her.

155
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,336
Well, I hope you have a plan B.

156
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:10,789
I do.

157
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:13,732
Awesome. OK. Let's clear out.

158
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,048
<i>Remember what that footprint looks like.</i>

159
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:24,759
<i>Huh?</i>

160
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,840
<i>What's all that black stuff?</i>

161
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,699
<i>Charcoal and a stove.</i>

162
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,225
<i>Was the killer gonna use this to...</i>

163
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,533
No! No!

164
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,068
Satoru. Flipping out isn't going to help.

165
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:50,619
Yeah, you're right.

166
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,717
<i>I gotta keep a clear head.</i>

167
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,309
All right, let's get going.

168
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,169
It was such a cool hideout.

169
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,967
Right, but not if some weirdo's using it, too.

170
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:03,992
Yeah.

171
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,851
<i>However we do it,</i>

172
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,512
<i>we need to make damn sure Kayo
stays out of the killer's range.</i>

173
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,392
<i>But now, with Child Protective Services on the case,</i>

174
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:15,394
<i>the future has to change.</i>

175
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:18,910
<i>It's got to.</i>

176
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,797
Wait, this is plan B?

177
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,938
Mm‐hmm. Simple, huh?

178
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,894
There's just one last hurdle.

179
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,431
It would have saved us a lot of
hassle if you'd thought of...

180
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,577
I'm home.

181
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,378
It's about time.

182
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,258
Um, uh... hello.

183
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:41,286
Hello.

184
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:44,716
All right, what's going on?

185
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,539
I'm helping a friend in trouble, that's what.

186
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,908
Way to go, guys. Good job.

187
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:07,871
I was hoping you'd be OK with this.

188
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,504
For a sec, I thought you were gonna kick my butt.

189
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,462
<i>I did it again.</i>

190
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,978
Now, why on earth would you think that?

191
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,282
This is exactly what friends are for.

192
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:24,106
What ya cookin'?
I could smell it when I came in.

193
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:27,363
Oh, nothing much.
Just a big, fat pot of curry is all.

194
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,480
I had a feeling you'd be bringing
over a couple of friends tonight.

195
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,649
<i>My mom can read me like a book.</i>

196
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,608
Don't just stand there, pull up a chair.

197
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:36,866
Would you like some curry?

198
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,598
‐Yes, please.
‐It smells yummy.

199
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,498
It's good I brought everyone 'cause you made a ton.

200
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:47,877
If you didn't, you'd be eating
curry for the rest of the month.

201
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,507
Um, Ms. Fujinuma.

202
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,973
I brought this back.
It was delicious.

203
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,003
Well, my job's done for the night.

204
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:04,503
Have fun washing the dishes, kiddo.

205
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:05,826
Thanks, Mom.

206
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,250
‐See you later. ‐Bye‐bye.
‐Later, guys.

207
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:15,040
Mr. Yashiro?
This is Satoru Fujinuma's mom.

208
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,066
Actually, I do.

209
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:21,041
Satoru just brought Kayo back to my place and she's OK.

210
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,631
Ah, what a relief.
That's good to hear.

211
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,533
I knew they were in this together.

212
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:30,033
Yeah, it's great,
but what happens to her now?

213
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,197
Will she be put in foster care?

214
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,469
<i>Good question.</i>

215
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:37,518
<i>You know, I've been thinking
about it and I might have an idea.</i>

216
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,954
No. We tried to,
but her mother wasn't home.

217
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,751
Maybe you can help.
But only if you don't mind.

218
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,076
Seven a. m.?

219
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,259
OK, see you tomorrow.

220
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,227
Hey, Kayo,
you want to spend the night?

221
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,195
Mm‐hmm.

222
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:00,832
Hello?

223
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:02,648
I'm sorry to call so late.

224
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:06,277
I'm Gaku Yashiro, a teacher at Mikoto Elementary.

225
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,867
I need to talk to you about Kayo.

226
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,500
He's called Wonder Guy.
Isn't he cool?

227
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:17,218
OK, guys, bath time.
Who wants to go first?

228
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,197
I'll go after you.

229
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,970
You know what,
how about we go together?

230
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:33,194
Hey, Kayo, come here and let me wash your hair.

231
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,135
Um, no, thank you.
I can do it.

232
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,049
It's OK, I want to.

233
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:43,650
How are we doing, miss?
Are we feeling fabulous yet?

234
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,035
And now it's time for...

235
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,762
- ‐Tickle‐tickle‐tickle‐tickle!
- ‐

236
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:55,353
And more tickles!

237
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:58,898
‐ And more, and more!
‐

238
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,348
<i>Hello! You're 29.</i>

239
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,653
We better dry your hair or you're gonna catch a cold.

240
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,393
Um, you guys, like,
have a good bath?

241
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:21,778
Yeah. It was lots of fun.

242
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,161
That's good.

243
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:27,004
Wait... those your pajamas?

244
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,031
Now they are.
I bought them for her.

245
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,137
<i>Witch!</i>

246
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,360
These are fresh and ready to go.

247
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,395
‐They're super soft.
‐Thank you.

248
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:37,825
Have you done this before?

249
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,586
You've gotta pull your end tight.

250
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,894
This totally reminds me,

251
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:44,500
the class took a trip to Hakodate

252
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,947
and the view from the top of the mountain was rad.

253
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:49,791
What? You've never been to Hakodate.

254
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:53,280
‐ Crap!
‐Must have been a photo I saw.

255
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,470
O... K.

256
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:58,403
- ‐You ready for lights‐out?
- ‐ Yes.

257
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,351
What's so funny?

258
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,211
My house doesn't have
a nightlight.

259
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:07,122
Oh, yeah?
I can turn it off if you want.

260
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:11,497
‐Uh‐uh. It's fine like this.
‐Why don't we leave it on tonight?

261
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,563
You got it.

262
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,167
Thanks, Satoru.

263
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,132
Good night, guys.

264
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:19,379
- ‐ Good night.
- ‐ Good night, Mom.

265
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,687
I'm not in the way here, am I?

266
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,524
- ‐ Yep.
- ‐ No, of course not!

267
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,994
- ‐ Oh, there I go again...
-  ‐

268
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,974
- What'd you do that for?
- Oops.

269
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,114
‐I meant to do this. And this!
‐ Ow! Stop it!

270
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,321
- ‐ Never!
- ‐

271
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,448
You're an idiot.

272
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,544
Good morning.

273
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,176
- ‐ Morning.
- ‐ You awake?

274
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,928
If you are, shake a leg.
Breakfast is gonna get cold.

275
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,405
OK.

276
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,654
I'm starving.

277
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,585
Wait, no curry?

278
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,072
That's your dinner,
for the next month.

279
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:35,000
What?
There can't be that much left.

280
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,560
You'll just have to invite everyone over again.

281
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,006
Goddamn little...

282
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,564
Mom?

283
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,490
Kayo, you little shit.
Where the hell have you been?!

284
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,586
I'll show...

285
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,937
I should have known.
