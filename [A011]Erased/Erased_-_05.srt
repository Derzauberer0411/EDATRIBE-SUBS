1
00:00:00,897 --> 00:00:03,967
<i>Kayo's late. Again.</i>

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:07,370
<i>But she said she was gonna</i>
<i>give me my present today.</i>

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,207
<i>Maybe she was up all night</i>
<i>making it and overslept.</i>

4
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,176
‐ Satoru?
<i>‐Yeah.</i>

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,542
‐Satoru?
‐Huh? Yes, sir!

6
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:18,840
Everything all right,
or is there something on your mind?

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,228
Kayo?!

8
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:33,830
Open up, it's me!

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,732
Kayo!

10
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:47,092
<i>Oh, no.</i>

11
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,023
<i>Rubber boot tracks.</i>

12
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:58,654
<i>Too big to be a kid's.</i>

13
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:01,557
<i>It snowed two nights ago.</i>

14
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:03,159
<i>And these tracks are fresh.</i>

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,430
<i>Whoever was here was an adult.</i>
<i>Probably male.</i>

16
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:13,285
Shit.
Now what do we do?

17
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:11,052
<i>I didn't go back to school</i>
<i>for two days.</i>

18
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,767
<i>Huh. I guess Mom went</i>
<i>to the store.</i>

19
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,665
I found out a kid got snatched not
too long ago over in the next town.

20
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,670
But the cops already caught
that scumbag.

21
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:28,034
This guy is someone new.
We have to warn people before he does it again.

22
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,296
The problem is the police put a gag order on the story.

23
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:35,587
What about airing it when kids aren't watching?
The station could do that easy.

24
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,883
And I can go talk to the school
and see if they'll issue a warning.

25
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:43,547
‐ OK. I'll talk to the boss about your idea.
‐ I'd appreciate it.

26
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:47,910
<i>He's a reporter for Ishikari TV.
My Mom used to work with him.</i>

27
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:52,786
The last thing I want is for Satoru to
grow up with horrible memories like this.

28
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,998
I hear you.

29
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:57,140
<i>Making me forget was her idea.</i>

30
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,721
I know you're worried,
but you gotta eat something.

31
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,999
What happened
isn't your fault, kiddo.

32
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,494
I tried
but I couldn't help her.

33
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:09,296
I don't know about that.

34
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,665
I just... I didn't
want her to be alone.

35
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:14,935
And thanks to you,
she wasn't.

36
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,538
It wasn't enough.
I should have done more.

37
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,408
Look, what happened happened.

38
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,211
So it's pointless to beat
yourself up about it.

39
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:28,481
In a situation like hers,
there’s only so much anyone could have done.

40
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,784
That goes for you and me.

41
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,986
You should go back to school tomorrow.

42
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:36,757
- ‐You'll just feel worse staying here alone.
-  ‐ OK.

43
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:39,359
Good. Now eat up, OK?

44
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,194
Yeah.

45
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:45,899
I, uh,
have a confession.

46
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,303
The other day, I told you Kayo was
home with a cold. That's not true.

47
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,674
She's staying with her grandmother
in Sapporo for personal reasons.

48
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:58,111
It happened so fast,
she didn't have a chance to say goodbye.

49
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,480
But don’t worry,
I hear she's doing well.

50
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,451
She ran away.

51
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,387
I heard Kayo's mom
hit her with a broom.

52
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,989
Oh, my God, really?

53
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,224
It's better
she's with her grandma.

54
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,160
Hey, Satoru.

55
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,569
‐Cheer up, man.
‐Yeah, don't worry.

56
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,830
‐You'll see her again.
‐Mm‐hmm.

57
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:24,693
Satoru, the school and the PTA talked
about it and decided this was for the best.

58
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:28,331
I hate to ask this, but could
you go along with the story?

59
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,598
Sure.

60
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,934
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:35,238
<i>The press couldn't</i>
<i>talk about it either.</i>

62
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:40,476
<i>And for the past few days,
the police had a car parked outside Kayo's house.</i>

63
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:46,015
<i>They were watching it because they
pegged her mom as the prime suspect.</i>

64
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:52,005
<i>Then, six days</i>
<i>after Kayo disappeared...</i>

65
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,822
Listen up, everyone,
I have an announcement.

66
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:02,058
From now on, when you leave school,
make sure you're either with your parents...

67
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,005
<i>...the next girl was kidnapped,</i>

68
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,599
<i>sooner than</i>
<i>she should have been.</i>

69
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:11,226
You hear
about Aya Nakanishi?

70
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:15,338
I don't know if you knew her,
but she was a student at Izumi Elementary.

71
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,606
I heard.

72
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:21,278
I have a friend who goes there and he said
she ran away to go live with her grandfather.

73
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:24,982
She did, huh?
Just like Kayo.

74
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:28,118
She didn't run away.
That’s a lie.

75
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,057
If you ask me, there's
a kidnapper on the loose.

76
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:38,896
<i>The details might not be</i>
<i>exactly the same,</i>

77
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:43,412
<i>but things were definitely following
the same flow of time as before.</i>

78
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:50,908
<i>Stations ran stories on the missing girls all
day, except Ishikari TV.</i>

79
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,163
<i>They only ran them early in
the morning and late at night.</i>

80
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:58,816
<i>So parents were advised to have
their kids watch Ishikari TV only.</i>

81
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,184
‐
‐ I'm home.

82
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:14,164
<i>After Aya Nakanishi went
missing, I noticed something.</i>

83
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:17,783
<i>The cops had dialed back</i>
<i>their stakeout at Kayo's place.</i>

84
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,970
<i>They must have realized a serial
kidnapper was on the loose.</i>

85
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,712
<i>Ten days after Kayo disappeared...</i>

86
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:46,191
<i>I saw her mom toss out</i>
<i>a bag of trash.</i>

87
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,299
<i>A pair of mittens was in it.</i>

88
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:55,265
<i>I'll give you</i> <i>your present tomorrow.
</i> <i>Promise.</i>

89
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,593
<i>Where am I?</i>

90
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:34,144
‐I'm back in 2006 again.
‐

91
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,998
Address: 23‐1 Fourth Street.

92
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:41,392
Victim: Sachiko Fujinuma.
Female, 52.

93
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:45,355
Suspect is her son,
Satoru Fujinuma, 29.

94
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,142
We're talking
to the eyewitness now.

95
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,769
Over.

96
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,673
‐
‐ Are you Satoru Fujinuma?

97
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:57,968
<i>No, it wasn't me!</i>
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

98
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:02,505
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
<i>I couldn't save Kayo.</i>

99
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:06,543
<i>Mom's still dead.
Everyone still thinks I killed her.</i>

100
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,007
<i>I couldn't change anything after all.</i>

101
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:12,127
<i>Only one thing to do.</i>

102
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:13,923
<i>Run.</i>

103
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:23,499
<i>I'm hiding under a bridge in a box.</i>

104
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,901
<i>Talk about clichés.</i>

105
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,037
<i>I wonder if I made the news yet.</i>

106
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,272
<i>Come on, think.</i>

107
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,074
<i>Why was Mom murdered?</i>

108
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,510
<i>Did she know who the killer was?</i>

109
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,080
<i>When I found her, I didn't see</i>
<i>her phone anywhere.</i>

110
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,083
<i>Or her bag.</i>
<i>They were both gone.</i>

111
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,754
<i>The killer took 'em, but why?</i>

112
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:49,218
<i>I bet she had evidence on him,
and he was scared the cops would find it.</i>

113
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,442
<i>Shit.</i>

114
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:57,333
<i>I'm crashing hard.</i>

115
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,803
<i>If I only had a day to sleep,</i>
<i>I'd think better.</i>

116
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:11,247
‐ There you go.Eat up.
‐ Thanks.

117
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,195
I'm sorry about work today.

118
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,469
It's no big deal.
One no‐show won't get you fired.

119
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:18,587
Airi was worried about you, though.

120
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,065
I wasn't 'cause I figured you
had a pretty good reason.

121
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,335
We can talk about it after we eat.

122
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,917
Thanks.

123
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,012
That sucks. Fight with your mom
was that bad, huh?

124
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,332
‐Yeah.
‐That's the trouble with old folks.

125
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:38,686
They can be hella stubborn.
You can crash here as long as you want.

126
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:41,402
But your mom's your mom,
so try and patch things up with her.

127
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:42,836
I will.

128
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,529
Hey,
you want a beer?

129
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:47,027
- ‐ No.
- ‐ Crap, I'm all out.

130
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,871
I'm gonna go out
and get some more.

131
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,203
<i>He's kind of a knob,
but his heart's in the right place.</i>

132
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,214
<i>I feel bad for lying.</i>

133
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:03,599
<i>Police rushed to the apartment
after receiving an anonymous tip.</i>

134
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:08,123
<i>Inside, they found the body of a woman
believed to be the tenant's mother.</i>

135
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:11,317
<i>The suspect, described as</i>
<i>a male in his late 20s,</i>

136
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,078
<i>fled the scene</i>
<i>before he could be questioned.</i>

137
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,453
<i>The police are currently searching
the neighborhood for him.</i>

138
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:18,718
<i>This is not good.</i>
<i>This is so not good.</i>

139
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,300
<i>And now the sports minute.</i>

140
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,639
<i>Japan's soccer team is heading
for the playoffs in Germany today</i>

141
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,799
<i>for what some are calling the most...</i>

142
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,670
<i>Should have known he'd screw me over.</i>

143
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,872
<i>What am I saying? I can't blame him.</i>

144
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,927
<i>He was just trying to do the right thing.</i>

145
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:37,160
<i>If I was in his shoes, I'd do the same.</i>

146
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:38,334
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

147
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,331
Uggh!

148
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,337
‐
‐ You're an idiot.

149
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:55,861
Airi?

150
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:59,576
No way! You called me by my first name?
That's a first.

151
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,943
You know, if you're on the run,
you shouldn't leave your phone on.

152
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,373
The police can use GPS
to track you.

153
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:06,304
Oh.

154
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:11,108
Are you just gonna sit there?
Hop on, let's go.

155
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:13,072
Come on, shake a leg.

156
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,124
Sorry about this, Katagiri.

157
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,704
Call me Airi.

158
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,074
It's one of the perks
of riding tandem.

159
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,487
I can't believe
you let me in your house.

160
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,614
You do know why
they're after me, right?

161
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,958
The cops came to see
the manager today.

162
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,968
I overheard them
talking about it.

163
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,838
‐It was on the news, too.
‐Then why did you risk helping me get away?

164
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:41,674
'Cause you didn't kill her, that's why.

165
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:45,603
At dinner, I could see how much you
guys meant to each other. That's a fact.

166
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:48,519
Yeah, well...

167
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:49,785
Thank you.

168
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:51,481
You don't have to thank me.

169
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:55,143
I can't imagine what you're going through,
and to have the cops after you, too?

170
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:56,861
You don't deserve that.

171
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:01,190
No one deserves the kind of stuff
you've been through before, either.

172
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:01,983
What?

173
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:07,461
This. You left it behind
at work the other day.

174
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:10,909
One of the chapters had a stickie
so I went ahead and read it.

175
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:14,111
Talked all about what happened in
your hometown when you were a kid,

176
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,355
how Kayo Hinazuki was murdered.

177
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:19,161
I cried when I read it.

178
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,331
She died the day of the Girls Festival.

179
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,721
It says that?

180
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:27,053
Yeah. It says she died
on March 3rd.

181
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:31,258
Anyway, make yourself at home.

182
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,987
I have to take the bike back
before they miss it.

183
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:38,008
And don't even think
about leaving this room.

184
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,840
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>how it was before.</i>

185
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:49,319
<i>It changed.</i>
<i>I changed it.</i>

186
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,677
<i>If I can go back again,</i>
<i>I can save Kayo.</i>

187
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:05,572
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm in Airi's room.</i>

188
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,173
<i>"Dear Satoru,</i>

189
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:09,542
<i>I think I should stick</i>
<i>to my normal schedule today,</i>

190
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,072
<i>so I'm going in to work</i>
<i>my usual shift.</i>

191
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,472
<i>The fam said they'd be</i>
<i>leaving the house around 10</i>

192
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:17,490
<i>and won't be coming back</i>
<i>till after 8 tonight.</i>

193
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:22,121
<i>The key to the house and my
bike are next to my clock.</i>

194
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>Here's the number to my cell.</i>

195
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,028
<i>Wait. 
I thought her last name was Katagiri.</i>

196
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,443
Thank you,
Mr. Nishizono!

197
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,550
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate it.

198
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:39,712
Well, your father's done so much for
me, I wish I could do more.

199
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:42,405
Oh, God, no, believe me,
you've done enough.

200
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,313
Heck, my dad couldn't be happier.

201
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:46,831
Thanks to that stoplight
and crosswalk you approved,

202
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:49,325
we get more customers now
than ever before.

203
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,217
Please.
Your business is doing well

204
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,934
because your father is
a shrewd businessman.

205
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:57,423
All I did was give him
a little boost, that's all.

206
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,956
Besides, it's a school route.
Safety first, you know.

207
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:04,787
The city council's been talking about
putting a stoplight here for ages.

208
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:07,559
I left the receipts by the till.
Heading home.

209
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,002
Sure. Nice hustle today, Airi.

210
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,987
- ‐What you got there?
-  ‐ Oh, just some leftover pizza.

211
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,737
Leftovers, are you kidding?
Go on, get a fresh one. My treat.

212
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:20,368
Thanks for the offer, boss, 
but this will do.

213
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,679
My friend won't know the difference anyway.

214
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,317
Oh, 
uh, I hope she likes it, then.

215
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,930
That is, if your friend's a, you know, girl.

216
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,221
Yeah, well...
see you tomorrow.

217
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,407
She’s a cute girl, huh?

218
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:39,459
Yeah, I guess,
if you're into that sort of thing.

219
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:42,469
I mean she's 17.
She's just a kid.

220
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:46,038
Yeah, well... I should
get back to the office.

221
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,201
Thanks for stopping by, sir.

222
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:04,825
Hey, Airi!

223
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:08,704
‐What's up?
‐Here. You forgot to take this.

224
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,797
It is part of the promotion
after all.

225
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:12,532
Oh. OK, thanks.

226
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:16,168
I was wondering, have you talked
to Satoru lately?

227
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,612
‐No.
 ‐I can't believe he'd just up and kill his own...

228
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,812
I mean, you know
what they're saying he did.

229
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:24,700
‐It's not like the guy at all.
‐No, it isn't.

230
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,677
I don't know how tight you guys were,but if you see him,

231
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:29,766

do what you can to help him, OK?

232
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,583
Sure.

233
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:34,049
Let him know we're on his side.
And if you talk to him, give me a shout.

234
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,884
Yeah, I totally will.

235
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,842
<i>What am I doing?</i>

236
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,002
<i>I doubt I'm gonna find</i>
<i>anything.</i>

237
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:51,403
<i>A kid disappeared here.</i>
<i>Three years ago.</i>

238
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,227
<i>Yeah, I think I remember this.</i>

239
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,366
<i>And three weeks later,</i>
<i>they arrested some guy for it.</i>

240
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,513
<i>Even after the trial,</i>
<i>he swore he was innocent.</i>

241
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:04,659
<i>It's a hell of a coincidence.</i>

242
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:07,053
<i>Or... is it?</i>

243
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:23,235
Why would you wanna go
and call the police for?

244
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,004
Airi!

245
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,700
Is that why you wanted me
to help Satoru?

246
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,943
You said you were on his side.
You said that!

247
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,796
Wait a sec, Airi.
I just...

248
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,215
I was worried about you,
that's all.

249
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,296
If all you wanted was to get him caught,
you should have told me the truth!

250
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,966
I trusted you!
I trusted you and you lied to me!

251
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,478
I didn't want to see you get hurt,
 I swear.

252
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:57,036
‐ That I believe.
‐I'm sorry.

253
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,238
Boss, please...

254
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,741
If you're really worried about me,

255
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,266
then don't call the police over here.

256
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,779
I don't want my family
getting involved in this.

257
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,893
I'm sorry, Satoru.

258
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:22,396
Nah, it's no big deal.
I got to sleep a bit,

259
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:25,396
so thanks for letting me stay
and conk out on your floor.

260
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,474
No, don't mention it.
I just wish you could go back.

261
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,091
It's OK.
It's better if I don't.

262
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,346
By the way, that's not
your parents' house, is it?

263
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,583
Huh‐uh. I'm staying
with my uncle and his wife.

264
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,759
My town doesn't have a high school.

265
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,621
It's out in the boonies,
so I had to come to the city for it.

266
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,298
I asked my uncle and he said
I could stay with them in Chiba.

267
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,461
- ‐ Mind if I ask a weird question?
-  ‐ Hmm‐mm.

268
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:55,108
Like, why do you believe me?
You don't even know me all that well.

269
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,871
You're right, I don't,
but I don't care.

270
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:00,662
I want to believe you.

271
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,193
<i>When I was</i>
<i>in elementary school,</i>

272
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,897
<i>my dad took me</i>
<i>grocery shopping one day.</i>

273
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:14,251
<i>The owner stopped my dad and
accused him of stealing a candy bar.</i>

274
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,687
<i>Like I said, my town's small,</i>
<i>so the owner knew my dad.</i>

275
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:21,025
<i>He said if he just admitted stealing
it, he'd drop the whole thing.</i>

276
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,981
<i>But he refused, and the owner</i>
<i>kept pushing him.</i>

277
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,959
<i>I never heard my dad yell before,</i>

278
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,194
<i>but that day he went off.</i>

279
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,958
<i>The owner ended up calling the police.</i>

280
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,794
<i>And since my dad belonged</i>
<i>to the local farmers' co‐op,</i>

281
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,987
<i>they gave him a three‐month</i>
<i>suspension as punishment.</i>

282
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:42,905
You didn't steal it, Daddy. 
I know! I saw, you didn't do anything wrong!

283
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:46,593
<i>After what happened,</i>
<i>Dad quit the co‐op,</i>

284
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,738
<i>divorced Mom, and left.</i>

285
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,289
<i>I guess my Mom thought</i>
<i>he really stole it.</i>

286
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,491
<i>Like everyone else in town.</i>

287
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:59,964
If someone believes in you,
you're not alone.

288
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:03,624
And if I was in your situation,
I'd want someone to believe me.

289
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,712
I think you should go home.

290
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:10,049
Tell the cops I forced you to hide me.
They'll buy that story.

291
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,519
God, you're an idiot.
You can't deal with this on your own.

292
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,145
And I won't lie to the police.

293
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:19,106
- ‐OK, but could you not call me an idiot anymore?
-  ‐

294
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,758
No promises!

295
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,962
I'll be back in a sec with a change
of clothes and stuff for you.

296
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,485
<i>The boss didn't call the police after all.
Good for him.</i>

297
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,606
But...

298
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,210
it can't be.

299
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,475
What is this?

300
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,123
It can't be from him 'cause he
told me his mom's phone was gone.

301
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,850
Unless he found it.

302
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,578
<i>No, it's from the killer.</i>

303
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,232
<i>He's after me now.</i>

304
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,237
Oh, my God!

305
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,867
Gotta get out!

306
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:06,967
I gotta...
