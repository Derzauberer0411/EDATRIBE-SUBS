1
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:09,303
Satoru Fujinuma, you're under arrest for
murder, attempted murder, and arson.

2
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,514
<i>It's him.</i>

3
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,629
<i>It can't end like this.</i>

4
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:38,483
<i>I can't let it.</i>

5
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:43,604
<i>There's still something I have to do.</i>

6
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:50,181
Move it.

7
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:52,024
<i>Go back.</i>

8
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:54,644
<i>Go back!</i>

9
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:58,098
<i>Just once more!</i>

10
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,572
<i>Please.</i>

11
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,385
<i>Please!</i>

12
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:07,081
Go baaaaack!

13
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,902
I'm glad I had the guts to come today.

14
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,485
So am I.

15
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:41,354
I'm real glad.

16
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,921
You're an idiot.

17
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,673
- ‐ Hey, guys.
- ‐ Hi, Kayo.

18
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,867
‐What's up? 
‐I finished the stuff I had to do early.

19
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:55,263
- ‐Sorry we got here so late.
- ‐ Is it OK we came?

20
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:58,033
Yeah, of course it is.
Right, Kayo?

21
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,082
<i>I have to pull this off.</i>

22
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,682
<i>This time I will.</i>
<i>Definitely.</i>

23
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:09,151
<i>I'm gonna do whatever it takes,
no matter how drastic, to change things,</i>

24
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:12,124
<i>'cause I know I won't get another chance.</i>

25
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:16,254
<i>This is my last Revival.</i>

26
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,304
‐ Man, I'm starving.
‐ Let's go eat, then.

27
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:51,837
I don't got any money.

28
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,912
Oh, I do. My allowance should cover all of us.

29
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:56,689
How about okonomiyaki?

30
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,883
‐Whoo‐hoo!
‐You rock, man!

31
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,646
All right!

32
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,180
Hey, Satoru,
 have you read that book I let you borrow yet?

33
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:07,915
Poe's "The Switched Man."
I gave it to you last week.

34
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,304
Oh, right. I haven't yet.

35
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,308
<i>No.</i>

36
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,684
<i>I don't remember him loaning me a book back then.</i>

37
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:18,894
It's a cool story.
When you get home, check it out.

38
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,692
I'm back.

39
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,607
Hey there, kiddo.

40
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,460
Dinner will be ready in a minute.
Hope you brought your appetite.

41
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:35,042
What's wrong, Satoru?
Go on, wash your hand...

42
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,474
Did you and Kayo have a fight?

43
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,278
No. It's nothing.

44
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,185
OK.

45
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,412
Well, go wash up.

46
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,260
Mom, 
if you ever feel like going to Ueno...

47
00:04:55,624 --> 00:05:00,562
remember, 
you don't have to change trains to get there.

48
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,687
I'll keep that in mind.

49
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:09,961
<i>February 29th, 1988.</i>

50
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:14,787
<i>The day before Kayo was supposed to be
kidnapped and murdered by a serial killer.</i>

51
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,489
<i>This is my third time around.</i>

52
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:20,101
You’re holding hands and everything now!

53
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:23,135
<i>It was the 28th when he said that before.</i>

54
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,856
<i>This time it's all or nothing.</i>

55
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:33,650
Kenya,
I'm sorry, but...

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,615
I think I lost that book you loaned me.

57
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,382
You didn't lose it. 
I never gave it to you.

58
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,282
The book's not real.
I made it up.

59
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,922
Can I talk to you in private?

60
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,751
Lately...
How do I say this?

61
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,270
Lately I noticed a change in how you are with people.

62
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,489
It feels like you care now.

63
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,416
You've always been friendly,
but before it sort of seemed like you were,

64
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,812
I don't know, faking it.

65
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,301
I could tell you were trying
hard to get along with everyone.

66
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,406
Anyway,
 I like the new you better.

67
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:13,752
So after all that, the reason I wanted to
talk to you is 'cause I have a question.

68
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,426
Satoru, who are you?

69
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:24,487
It's like you've turned into a totally different person.

70
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:28,349
Or like there's a totally different person inside you now.

71
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:33,202
I realized it a few days ago,

72
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,196
when I saw you staring at Kayo during class.

73
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:40,158
I've seen bruises on her a bunch of times before.

74
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:43,544
But I never said anything to anyone about it.

75
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:48,493
I guess 
I didn't think it was any of my business.

76
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,108
But when you noticed what was going on with her,

77
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,350
you actually did something.

78
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,369
That took guts.

79
00:06:57,394 --> 00:07:00,298
You decided to help her without a second thought.

80
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,357
You did what I was scared to.

81
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,106
Come on,
 tell me who you really are.

82
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:12,115
<i>I... I...</i>

83
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,079
<i>I'm...</i>

84
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,342
I'm a superhero.

85
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,644
Or... I wanna be.

86
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,515
That settles it.
You're Satoru.

87
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,617
Kayo's gonna die if I don't do something about it.

88
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,254
I know her mom's been hitting her,

89
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,099
and I swear I'm gonna put an end to it.

90
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,628
Lemme get this straight.

91
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,224
You think if you save her,
it will make you a superhero?

92
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,653
Well, if you ask me,
that makes you one already.

93
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:55,239
And I wanna be one, too.
So let me help.

94
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,693
Whaddya say?

95
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,680
I always heard opposites attract,
so I didn't think you'd like Kayo.

96
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,306
I mean,
you're kind of the same.

97
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:11,853
I didn't like her at first, but... I don't know.

98
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,386
There's something about her.

99
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,954
Huh.
I think I get what you mean.

100
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:24,096
Kenya, Satoru.
You're the bucket brigade.

101
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:29,604
Superheroes always get the shaft, don't they?

102
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,369
<i>Damn straight.</i>

103
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,445
Oh, I just remembered.

104
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,028
I have to check on something.

105
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,023
Can I meet you guys at the Children's Center?

106
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,181
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Sure.

107
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,639
<i>Tomorrow's March 1st.</i>

108
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:48,923
<i>As long as Kayo's not alone at the park, she'll be safe.</i>

109
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,140
<i>The problem's March 2nd, though,</i>

110
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,967
<i>the day of our birthday party.</i>

111
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,584
<i>I wanna give Yuuki an alibi.</i>

112
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:01,834
Hey, Yuuki, is your dad's
bedroom on the first floor?

113
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,003
Uh... yeah.

114
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,481
His room faces the street.
What's up?

115
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,969
Oh, nothing.
 I bet it gets noisy at night, though.

116
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,454
N‐No, not really.

117
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,997
<i>Good.</i>
<i>One last thing to check.</i>

118
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,781
Yuuki, you ever play with Kayo?

119
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,777
Wh‐Why?

120
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:27,613
It's just, she hangs with me and my friends now.

121
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,950
Oh, yeah?

122
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,610
So that's why I haven't seen her around lately.

123
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:46,339
Yes! Awesome! 
That's the best goddamn thing for her.

124
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:50,127
<i>That's the first time I ever heard
him use a cussword around me.</i>

125
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,344
T‐Take care. See you around.

126
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:56,762
Yeah, bye.

127
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:01,743
<i>The killer must have seen Yuuki with Kayo.</i>

128
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,005
<i>That's why he picked him to take the fall for her murder.</i>

129
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:09,110
<i>Don’t worry, Yuuki.
This time I'll stop it from happening.</i>

130
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,289
Kayo, Kenya?

131
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,384
Hiromi?

132
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,096
- I'm open.
- No way, dude!

133
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,194
‐ Pass it! -Over here!
‐ Hey, about time.

134
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:28,634
‐ Wanna shoot some hoops?
‐ Yeah, come on. Three‐on‐three.

135
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,502
<i>There was only me and her here last time.</i>

136
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,834
<i>I know what's gonna happen
between now and March 2nd,</i>

137
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,736
<i>but if things change too much,</i>
<i>I won't.</i>

138
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,630
<i>I gotta be careful about that.</i>

139
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,259
I'm home!

140
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,328
Ready and...

141
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,555
Kayo, Satoru.

142
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,047
‐Happy birthday!
‐Happy birthday, guys!

143
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,369
<i>March 1st was Day X</i>

144
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,497
<i>and everything happened the same as last time.</i>

145
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,927
<i>It's safe to start changing the future now.</i>

146
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,253
Darn it.
I left something at school.

147
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:18,090
‐ Can't it wait till tomorrow? We have company!
 ‐We'll save a slice for ya.

148
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:21,658
<i>It's weird bailing on the party,
but I can't worry about it.</i>

149
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,391
‐Here we go!
‐

150
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:41,024
What in the hell? Hey, who's there?!

151
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,024
<i>That takes care of that.
The cops are gonna be the perfect alibi for Yuuki.</i>

152
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:57,977
<i>Now for her.</i>

153
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,824
<i>I know how I can keep her away from Kayo.</i>

154
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,363
<i>One push. Just one push!</i>

155
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:19,593
I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

156
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,832
What if the fall kills her?

157
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,286
You don't want that.

158
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,959
You'd get caught and then you can't help anyone.

159
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:35,098
Satoru, I wasn't just passing by, I've been following you.

160
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,015
The past few days, you've been so desperate to save Kayo.

161
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,558
I was worried you'd do something drastic.

162
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:46,665
I'm sorry about that.
It's just...

163
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:49,994
I knew tonight was when she was
gonna be in the most danger.

164
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,352
Earlier, I watched you huck a big
old rock through someone's window.

165
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:56,813
Why did you do that?

166
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,686
Oh. Yeah, that.

167
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,014
I wanted the police there so I could help someone else.

168
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,358
Kenya,
I really need your help.

169
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,255
If we can get the police involved in this, 
they'll stop Kayo's mom.

170
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,290
I don't know, 
that could stir up all kinds of trouble.

171
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:21,767
That's what I'm hoping.

172
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,218
‐But there's a chance it will backfire on you. 
‐I know.

173
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:26,892
It's just an idea.

174
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm still working out the details.

175
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,197
I don't care what I do or if the police catch me.

176
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,758
<i>Or if they lock me up for good.</i>

177
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:38,573
I don't care what happens to me.

178
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,604
As long as Kayo's safe.

179
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,767
Well, just don't do anything that will get you arrested.

180
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,593
Your mom will kick your butt.

181
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,838
No she won't.
When she found out what I did,

182
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,595
she'd say, "Nice job, kiddo."

183
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,988
Yeah, I guess she would.

184
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:56,956
All right, what's next?

185
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:01,618
- ‐ I'm gonna walk Kayo home.
-  ‐ Sure, go for it.

186
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,845
Yeah, we can handle the cleaning up.

187
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:08,573
<i>This time I remembered to put
on a jacket and some gloves.</i>

188
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,503
‐Kayo...
‐Satoru...

189
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:14,072
Me first.

190
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:17,890
I was thinking,
can you let me kidnap you?

191
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,518
You're an idiot.

192
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,379
Yeah, but that's the best I could come up with.

193
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,446
OK.

194
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:39,295
I was hoping you would say that.

195
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,803
This is it.

196
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,262
Pretty cool, huh?

197
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,714
Izumi's Elementary's hockey club
used to use it as their hangout.

198
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,997
Hey, guys.
About time.

199
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,030
Are you sure this is OK?

200
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,724
Yeah. 
The school got a new one last year.

201
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,442
They use this for storage now.

202
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,127
We should open the vents before lighting the stove.

203
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,643
It's all rusted.

204
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,173
I'll cover the windows, you hang the blanket.

205
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,046
OK.

206
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,882
- ‐Cool.
- ‐ Wow!

207
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,651
It's an awesome hideout,
isn't it?

208
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,878
I wouldn't mind living here myself.

209
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:33,823
You'd miss having a shower, though.

210
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:37,496
Living in a proper house doesn't guarantee happiness.

211
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:42,664
Anyway... I should get going.

212
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,257
See you later, Kayo.

213
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:47,421
I should go home now, too,
but I'll come back later.

214
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,123
I'll knock three times.

215
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,677
Thanks, you guys.
I mean it. Thank you.

216
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,363
We're friends. You don't have to thank me, ever.

217
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,366
We're gonna keep you safe,
Kayo, promise.

218
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:09,256
- ‐ Ow!
-  ‐ Way to pour on the charm.

219
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,883
Yeah?
You should talk.

220
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:14,007
You sounded like you were
gonna ask her out or something.

221
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,794
You know I wouldn't do that to you.

222
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:19,447
I'm glad she's my friend,
and I know she's glad she's yours.

223
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,236
Thanks for helping.

224
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:26,071
Like I told her,
you don't have to thank me.

225
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:28,398
Besides,
the hard part's coming up.

226
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:32,984
Yeah. Listen,
if this does backfire on me,

227
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,419
make like you didn't know anything, 
OK?

228
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,439
OK.

229
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,658
I didn't think you were ever coming home.

230
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:46,351
Sorry.
We stopped along the way.

231
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,428
We got to talking about stuff.

232
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:49,822
Stuff, huh?

233
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:52,124
I think her mom was worried, too.

234
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:55,797
‐She didn't call here, did she?
‐Nope, she didn't.

235
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:58,724
Oh, I have to leave super early tomorrow,

236
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,264
but don't get up for me.

237
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,207
I'll have this for breakfast.

238
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,128
Mm‐hmm.

239
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,169
Come in.

240
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:29,807
Did I wake you?

241
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,809
No. I couldn't sleep.

242
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,944
I don't blame you.
You hungry?

243
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,792
It's good.

244
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:49,446
This stuff tastes better late at night, huh?

245
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,932
I never had them this late before.

246
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,091
Oh.

247
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,138
You know what? 
Me and the guys are gonna go camping this summer.

248
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,374
If you want, you should come.

249
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,947
I don't know if I can.

250
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,241
Sure you can.

251
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:09,320
Mm‐hmm.

252
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,666
Wake up.

253
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,890
We're gonna be late.

254
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,893
Good thing I stopped by.

255
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,993
Come on, we have to leave before
the kids from Izumi show up.

256
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,935
Where is Kayo? Anyone know?

257
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:47,357
<i>Just a reminder.</i>

258
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:52,021
<i>It's flu season, so don't forget
to wash your hands before lunch.</i>

259
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:56,207
I thought something would have happened by now.
What do you think?

260
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:59,295
Has her mom called the police?
Does she even know she's gone?

261
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:02,089
Maybe she hasn't looked for her yet.

262
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,278
<i>The last time,</i>
<i>it was March the 2nd.</i>

263
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,305
<i>I got Kayo home before 9:00.</i>

264
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,441
<i>After that, her mom and the boyfriend beat her.</i>

265
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,088
<i>Then her mom threw her in the shed,</i>

266
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:14,875
<i>and sometime after 10:00,</i>
<i>Kayo was kidnapped.</i>

267
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:18,881
<i>At 12:30 on the 3rd,</i>
<i>Kayo's mom called up my mom.</i>

268
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:22,835
<i>Then, sometime before dawn,</i>
<i>Kayo was murdered.</i>

269
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,449
<i>This time there have been major
changes to everyone's actions:</i>

270
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:30,049
<i>Kayo, her mom, us...</i>
<i>the killer.</i>

271
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,829
<i>Who knows what'll happen next?</i>

272
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:39,271
Yes, this is Gaku Yashiro,
from Mikoto Elementary.

273
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,884
Sure. Yes, I'll hold.

274
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,009
Let's hear it!

275
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,490
- ‐ One! Two...
- ‐ One! Two...

276
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,683
Just don't tell Kazu or Osamu.

277
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,456
Sorry for dragging you into this, Hiromi.

278
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:55,019
Oh, that's OK.
 I'm just stoked you guys trusted me.

279
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,620
Besides, my folks won't get back till 8:00,

280
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,981
so this is better than sitting home alone.

281
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:03,425
You're a trouper, Kayo.
You must be super bored.

282
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,763
Hmm‐mm. 
I haven't had this much fun in forever.

283
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,766
I'm glad I had the guts to do this.

284
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,411
Tomorrow morning,
I'll stop by your house.

285
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:15,039
Her mom won't have a choice
but to call the police then.

286
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,107
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐Hey.

287
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,809
I get why we're doing what we're doing,
 but what if we get in trouble?

288
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:24,258
Don’t worry about that.
I'll take the blame for what happens.

289
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,838
You're an idiot.
 This whole thing is because of me,

290
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,448
and all you guys are doing is trying to help.

291
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,751
No one's gonna blame anyone for that.

292
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,410
And I win.

293
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:42,578
You're right.

294
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,701
<i>Damn, she's smart.</i>

295
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:47,171
<i>On the way home, Kenya said,</i>

296
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:49,815
<i>"I bet you didn't think about that, huh?"</i>

297
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:53,277
<i>I said, "Nope," and then he said...</i>

298
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:56,522
<i>"In my book,</i>
<i>you</i> are <i>a superhero."</i>

299
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,740
<i>Is that... Satoru?</i>
