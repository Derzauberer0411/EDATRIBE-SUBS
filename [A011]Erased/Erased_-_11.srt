1
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:05,733
<i>I'd like to tell you a little story.</i>

2
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:10,020
<i>It happened a long time ago,</i>
<i>when I was in the sixth grade.</i>

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,746
<i>One day at school,
a girl brought a box of hamsters to class.</i>

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:16,831
<i>And she was very upset.</i>

5
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,695
<i>She said she started with two,
and before she knew it, they'd bred.</i>

6
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,812
<i>Now she had more than she could take care of.</i>

7
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,309
<i>I happily took them for her.</i>

8
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,009
<i>When I got home that day,</i>

9
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:30,092
<i>I filled a big wine jug with water.</i>

10
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:34,040
<i>Then I dropped the hamsters in one by one.</i>

11
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:36,723
<i>When I checked on them three hours later,</i>

12
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,297
<i>I couldn’t believe my eyes.</i>

13
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,128
<i>One hamster was still alive,</i>

14
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>standing atop the drowned corpse of one of its siblings.</i>

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,761
<i>And I was thrilled.</i>

16
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:52,702
<i>I named it Spice and decided to keep it for my pet.</i>

17
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,657
<i>Why? Because when I saw it in the jug,</i>

18
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:58,557
<i>it reminded me of a story called "The Spider's Thread."</i>

19
00:00:58,796 --> 00:00:59,796
<i>Do you know it?</i>

20
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:02,641
<i>It's about a sinner in Hell named Kandata</i>

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,994
<i>who, while alive, once spared a spider's life.</i>

22
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:08,179
<i>Moved by this act of compassion,</i>

23
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:11,929
<i>the Buddha lowered a spider's
thread from paradise down to him.</i>

24
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,368
<i>Kandata started climbing it,</i>
<i>and half way up,</i>

25
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:17,967
<i>he saw his fellow sinners climbing after him.</i>

26
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:20,946
<i>He tried to knock them off,</i>
<i>and then...</i>

27
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:24,076
<i>the thread snapped,</i>

28
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:27,276
<i>sending Kandata back down to Hell.</i>

29
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,605
<i>Now, what I'm about to tell you
next might sound hard to believe,</i>

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,100
<i>but if anyone could understand, 
it would be you.</i>

31
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,931
<i>Ever since I met Spice,</i>

32
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:42,074
<i>I could see the spider's thread on people.</i>

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,055
<i>Whomever it touched, I was compelled to kill.</i>

34
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:50,523
<i>But then a boy came along who disrupted my duties.</i>

35
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:54,084
<i>And wouldn't you know it,</i>
<i>I saw the spider's thread</i>

36
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,597
<i>attached to him.</i>

37
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,926
Yashiro!

38
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,947
I know your future!

39
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,267
<i>I tried to kill the boy, but he didn't die.</i>

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,509
<i>So I nicknamed him Spice,</i>

41
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:11,662
<i>and I kept a close eye on him.</i>

42
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:16,158
<i>That boy</i>
<i>was you, Satoru!</i>

43
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,248
That'll be 987 yen, please.

44
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,139
Thanks for shopping with us.

45
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:48,099
<i>Satoru mentioned something to me once about the train.</i>

46
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:54,215
Remember, you don't have to change trains to go to Ueno.

47
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>He was right.</i>

48
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,885
<i>But why did he point that out to me?</i>

49
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,925
Good morning, kiddo. Sleep well?

50
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,449
Huh.
He's in great shape

51
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,584
for someone who's been in a coma for 15 years.

52
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,867
Fifteen years.

53
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:13,765
Wow! Talking already.

54
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,596
It won't be long before you can start physical therapy.

55
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,452
<i>I heard that for the past 15 years,</i>

56
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:26,655
<i>mom spent four hours a day giving
every joint in my body a workout.</i>

57
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,241
<i>About three years ago,</i>

58
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:34,839
<i>she got one of those EMS monitor thingies
to let her know when I was conscious again.</i>

59
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,408
<i>She got another thing to stimulate my muscles.</i>

60
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:43,973
<i>When I was in fifth grade, I stood about 4½ feet tall.</i>

61
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,643
<i>I'm 5'5" now.</i>

62
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:51,582
<i>Dr. Kitamura said, if it wasn't for my mom,</i>

63
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,127
<i>I wouldn't be in as good a shape as I am.</i>

64
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,377
This might be difficult but I think you're ready for it.

65
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:00,379
Try to answer my next question.

66
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:03,232
What's the last thing you can remember,

67
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,653
before you lost consciousness, that is?

68
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,751
OK.
I remember I was...

69
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,872
Oh...

70
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:18,222
Wait.

71
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,553
Damn it.

72
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:26,794
<i>It's like these memories,</i>
<i>whatever they are,</i>

73
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,399
<i>are locked behind a door.</i>

74
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,879
That's you.

75
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,646
‐Well, aren't you surprised?
‐Hmm?

76
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,891
Your face has changed a lot.

77
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,311
The last time you saw it,
you were 11.

78
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:44,908
Well, I guess since your memories are scrambled,

79
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:48,619
it'll take a while before this all sinks in.
It's just a matter of time.

80
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,995
<i>That day, I thought maybe the doc was right.</i>

81
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,070
<i>I should have felt weird waking up in this time.</i>

82
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,390
<i>But I didn't.</i>

83
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,947
<i>But the thing is, I should have.</i>

84
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:04,446
<i>Patience, heart rate monitor, sense of loss, arbitration.</i>

85
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,376
<i>I knew those words.</i>

86
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:09,292
<i>But when did I learn them?</i>

87
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,534
<i>What the heck happened to me?</i>

88
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:18,759
Good morning, Satoru.

89
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:21,373
Good morning, Mom.

90
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:24,014
Guess what?
You've got some visitors.

91
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,135
Look who decided to wake up.

92
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,010
You look great.
How are you feeling?

93
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:32,263
<i>I remember Kenya and Hiromi.</i>

94
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,898
<i>They were two of my very best friends.</i>

95
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:38,235
<i>Kenya's a lawyer now and Hiromi's a doctor.</i>

96
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,183
<i>We talked for hours about this and that.</i>

97
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,993
<i>Now and then I got the feeling Kenya
wanted to ask me something, but he didn't.</i>

98
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:49,354
<i>Maybe Mom told him not to.</i>

99
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,355
<i>We just talked about trivial things.</i>

100
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:56,393
‐See ya later.
‐Take it easy.

101
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,533
<i>There was lots of stuff I wanted to ask the guys.</i>

102
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,609
<i>But Mom being Mom, I bet she wanted to
avoid that to spare me from the shock.</i>

103
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:11,477
<i>For 15 years, she dedicated herself to keeping me alive,</i>

104
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,633
<i>hoping I'd wake up one day.</i>

105
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,249
<i>She doesn't want me to remember what happened.</i>

106
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,311
<i>It's probably a good thing I don't.</i>

107
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,543
I got ya.

108
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,196
We'll try it again tomorrow, OK?

109
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,388
Satoru?

110
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,189
Congratulations, Kayo.

111
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,386
Yeah, I'm married.
My last name is Sugita.

112
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:14,097
No way.
So Hiromi's a dad now?

113
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:14,866
Mm‐hmm.

114
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:18,562
I got the feeling he wanted to tell me
something important: now I know what.

115
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,982
He looks just like him.
He's even got the same long eyelashes.

116
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,515
Yep. He's just like his daddy.

117
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:27,195
We named him Mirai.

118
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,090
That's a cool name.
It means "the future."

119
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:35,504
You know, we felt weird about getting together.

120
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:39,109
It didn't seem right for us to be happy.

121
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,646
We're alive because of what you did

122
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,336
and because of us,
you ended up in a coma.

123
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,998
It felt like...

124
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:49,310
like we were leaving you behind, I guess.

125
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,780
Kayo, whatever happened to me happened.

126
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,152
So don't go blaming yourself about it.

127
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,588
I don't have any regrets,
'cause in the end,

128
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm here 'cause it's where I'm supposed to be.

129
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:06,610
After being gone for 15 years,
you're still a smooth talker.

130
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,066
Oh, I am?

131
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,200
I get what you're saying,
Satoru,

132
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,704
but before you came along,
I thought I'd always be alone in life.

133
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:17,203
And here I am
with my very own family.

134
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,516
You made that possible,
so thank you.

135
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,161
<i>She said...</i>
<i>"thank you."</i>

136
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:27,198
<i>But I can't remember what for.</i>

137
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,663
Uh‐oh, someone's hungry.

138
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,069
OK, OK.

139
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:45,676
Satoru, are you OK?

140
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,467
Yeah.

141
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,824
I shouldn’t have sprung all this on you.

142
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,516
It's a lot to process.

143
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,320
Well, we'll see you later.

144
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,060
Yeah, see you later.

145
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:14,430
Hey, kiddo,
you have a good workout today?

146
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,300
Uh‐huh. Kayo came by a little while ago.

147
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,669
Mm. I bumped into her outside.

148
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,689
She's got the cutest baby.

149
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,777
Listen, Mom?

150
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:29,425
What's up?

151
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,564
‐Not those assholes again.
‐What?

152
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:38,164
Paparazzi from the gossip rags looking for a story.

153
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,023
Waking up after 15 years made you a celebrity.

154
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:43,225
‐Oh.
‐Screw 'em.

155
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,363
Anyway, you wanted to tell me something?

156
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,072
No. It wasn't important.

157
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:50,486
Come in.

158
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,470
-How are we doing?
-So far, so good, doc.

159
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,811
I was wondering...

160
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,536
when do you think I'll be able to walk again?

161
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:04,246
I don't know.
It depends on you.

162
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:07,449
If it's OK, I'd like to do twice as much rehab.

163
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,252
‐Why? ‐I wanna walk outside again.

164
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,556
Uh, sure, I'll see what I can do.

165
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,314
Sorry, I have to take this.

166
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,294
Yes, Director. Yes, sir.

167
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,530
He's doing great, actually.

168
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,394
He should get all his memoires back any time now.

169
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,379
I'm sorry, no.

170
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,470
Like I told you the other day,
I'm not comfortable with that.

171
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:33,126
With all due respect, he's my patient, not a guinea pig...

172
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,766
I have to go.

173
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,292
You're doing great,
Satoru.

174
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:44,336
Your arms and legs have gotten a lot stronger.

175
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,952
- Congratulations.
- Way to go!

176
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,915
You walked the whole way without our help.

177
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:14,178
Awesome job!

178
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:30,459
Hey, Satoru,
Kenya stopped by for a little visit.

179
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:32,118
Hi, Kenya.

180
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,034
I hope it's OK I stopped by.

181
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:36,131
Are you kidding?
Of course it is.

182
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,684
Hello, Satoru.

183
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,520
Have we met before?

184
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,397
Matter of fact,
we have.

185
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:48,056
Your mom and I used to work together back
before you started elementary school.

186
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,037
Oh.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,799
Come on, you honestly think he'd remember you?

188
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:53,926
That was like 20 years ago now.

189
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:00,590
All right,
take care, buddy.

190
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,264
See you later.

191
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,828
We've waited 15 years.
No reason to get impatient.

192
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:10,653
 ‐We should go easy on him.
 ‐ Yeah.

193
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,753
Hi, Kumi.

194
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:29,082
Ah, so the surgery's in two weeks, huh?

195
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,706
They're gonna put some of my
big sister's bone marrow in me.

196
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,000
They said it will cure me.

197
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:39,117
But even so, I'm scared.

198
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,073
<i>You were asleep for 15 years?!</i>

199
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,887
I know you've been at this hospital for a while.

200
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,890
‐What's it been, like three months now?
‐Mm‐hmm.

201
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,831
It's gonna be hard to stay motivated
in physical therapy once you leave.

202
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,445
You’re the reason I was working so hard.

203
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,357
Courage...

204
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:12,345
Whenever I need courage,
here's what I do.

205
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:16,040
I picture someone I really care about smiling.

206
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,770
It only works if I smile back, though.

207
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,150
"The time‐traveling pedo.

208
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,415
He wakes up an adult,
but he's still a kid at heart.

209
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,276
Still hot for little girls.

210
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,070
Soon he'll be released.
Hide your children."

211
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,054
‐What do you think?
‐Good angle.

212
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:38,178
Taking photos of a civilian without their permission.

213
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,372
Slander, trespassing.

214
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:43,533
If I see you again,
I'll call the police.

215
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,527
Get out of here. Now.

216
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:50,428
They were some of the prettiest flowers I'd ever seen.

217
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,091
Oh, hello, Mr. Nishizono.

218
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:54,830
Hello, Kumi.

219
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,995
‐Satoru Fujinuma.
‐Uh... yes?

220
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,807
It's me. Don't you remember?

221
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,057
It's OK. I've changed a lot
since the last time you saw me.

222
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,759
I was your homeroom teacher once,

223
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,597
when you were in fifth grade.

224
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:16,226
I'm Gaku Yashiro.

225
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,602
I go by Manabu Nishizono now.

226
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:21,255
I changed my name a while back.

227
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,734
Why did you change it,
if you don't mind me asking?

228
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,570
Not at all.
I got married five years ago

229
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,606
-and took on my wife's family's name.
- Oh.

230
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:34,048
My father‐in‐law was a city
council member for a long time.

231
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:36,442
But he passed away three years ago.

232
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:39,983
I joined the council and took over his constituency.

233
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:42,014
I kept the kanji for my given name,

234
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,797
but I use the more common reading now.

235
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,964
Wow. A real‐life politician.

236
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,158
Just a lowly council member.

237
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,742
Yeah, well, still, I get the feeling you'd
be super awesome at politics, Mr. Yashiro.

238
00:17:55,743 --> 00:18:00,662
Anyway, I met Kumi and her parents at
a charity event for kids with leukemia.

239
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,999
I know the director
of this hospital,

240
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,381
so I pulled some strings and got her in.

241
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:06,974
That's nice of you.

242
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:10,046
When I heard you came to,
I wanted to come visit.

243
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:13,475
I'm sorry it took me so long, 
but with work and all.

244
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,577
Well, thanks for taking the time.

245
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:22,455
To be honest, I've been looking forward
to this day for the past 15 years.

246
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,375
Yeah, well, me too.

247
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:28,098
You don't remember how close we were, do you?

248
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,656
I don't. Sorry.

249
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,555
No, it's all right.

250
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:37,468
They said it would take a while
before you got your memories back.

251
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,892
You'll remember me, in time.

252
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:22,128
Hello.

253
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:27,262
‐ Mr. Yashiro.
‐Were you on your way to see Kumi?

254
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:29,522
Yeah. Her surgery's coming up.

255
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,446
The nurses said today is the
last day she can have visitors.

256
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,767
True.
I just left her room.

257
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:38,438
She was asleep,
so unfortunately I couldn't talk to her.

258
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,220
Well, that sucks.
I guess I'll try seeing her later, then.

259
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,765
Uh... since you're here,
can I talk to you?

260
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,409
Sure, but let's go someplace
we can have some privacy,

261
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,317
away from these reporters.

262
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:56,593
Don't worry,
I know the perfect spot.

263
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,777
OK, here we are. 
I'll bet you didn't know about this elevator.

264
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,932
Feels like we're going on an adventure, huh?

265
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,785
Would you push the button for the roof?

266
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,443
Hmm. Too bad.

267
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,017
The sunset would have been amazing if it weren't raining.

268
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,153
At least we won't be bothered by any paparazzi up here.

269
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:52,004
But the roof's off‐limits so don't tell on me, OK?

270
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,272
It's funny, being up here reminds
me of how you, Kenya and Hiromi

271
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,147
always talked about going to your hideout after school.

272
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,632
Yashiro...

273
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,629
I remember everything,

274
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,071
you son of a bitch.
