1
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,782
Wait, come back!

2
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,615
American Anthropologist Edward Hall

3
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:26,282
divided the concept of personal
space into four general zones.

4
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:29,490
He named one of these the "intimate space" zone.

5
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:32,323
With the "close phase" contained therein.

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,532
The latter is near enough for someone to hug them.

7
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,407
Many resist letting others into this zone.

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,407
However, some people seem to enter

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,740
into everyone's close phase easily.

10
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,532
Kushida's one of those.

11
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,573
Even if she enters someone's close phase,

12
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:50,115
she manages not to trigger an aversive reaction.

13
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,157
Even so, Sakura resisted Kushida.

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,365
For some unknown reason, she ran away from her.

15
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,240
She couldn't even look her in the eye.

16
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,823
Why does she fear contact with others?

17
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,323
Um. I'm so sorry!

18
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,948
You two are very kind to agree to come with me for this.

19
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,282
No, this whole thing is my fault!

20
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:48,948
I'm the one who owes you an apology

21
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:50,365
for breaking your camera!

22
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:53,740
Thanks, but I should have been more careful.

23
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,907
So, you're going to the electronics store

24
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,365
where you got your camera to get it fixed.

25
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,823
I understand that part.

26
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,240
But why did I have to come?

27
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:06,198
I need you, too.

28
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,698
Man, what a bummer.

29
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:10,532
This is no good. I see what's wrong here.

30
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,782
Looks like a power issue if you ask me.

31
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,740
Mm. Definitely.

32
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,490
Do you have a warranty with you?

33
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,823
Should be covered.

34
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:22,198
You did remember to bring it with you, right?

35
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,698
Mm-hm.

36
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:29,448
It hasn't expired, yay!

37
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,448
You could have the broken part, uh--replaced.

38
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:33,615
Completely free of charge.

39
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,032
I see. Sakura's scared of strangers.

40
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:41,240
Of course, this guy would freak her out.

41
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:44,115
I'm here because she wanted strength in numbers.

42
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:47,657
Um. Do you know how long the repairs will take?

43
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,573
Two or three days max, I think.

44
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,157
But don't quote me.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,323
I need you to fill out this form, but not the whole thing.

46
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,948
Fill out your name here, home address,

47
00:03:57,032 --> 00:04:00,365
and your cell phone number.

48
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:07,990
Are you all right?

49
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:11,532
Uh, yeah.

50
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,490
Let me do it.

51
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:23,198
When the repairs are complete,

52
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:25,240
please contact me instead of Sakura.

53
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:26,907
What?! Hey, wait a minute!

54
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,990
The camera belongs to her, doesn't it?

55
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:31,990
I don't think we can do that.

56
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,948
I'm not comfortable with this.

57
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,448
You saw the warranty.

58
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:37,282
It notes the time and location of purchase

59
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,365
so you shouldn't need her information.

60
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,532
I understand that it's store policy,

61
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,448
but you won't get in trouble.

62
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,782
I can't imagine there being a legal issue.

63
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:46,865
You don't have to worry.

64
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:49,823
Well. Are you sure about that?

65
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:57,698
I guess we can do that this time.

66
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,823
By the way,

67
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,782
thank you very much for coming to my aid.

68
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:06,948
No problem. It was the least I could do to atone!

69
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,282
But, listen, Sakura. We're the same age.

70
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,407
You don't have to speak to us so formally.

71
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,115
I'd like to think we're friends!

72
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:15,282
Yes, you've been acting like we're your elders.

73
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,990
Um. Yeah.

74
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:19,782
Makes sense.

75
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:20,948
I will try.

76
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,490
I mean, I'll do my best.

77
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,532
No need to force anything, either!

78
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,115
Um. Right, I won't.

79
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:28,115
Mm-hm!

80
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,782
I'll be back in a bit.

81
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,532
I'm gonna go freshen up.

82
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,782
Being alone with her is awkward.

83
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Hm?

84
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,365
Is something on your mind?

85
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,657
Do you not feel comfortable with the--?

86
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,948
Listen. What do you think I should do?

87
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:55,573
I can't figure out what would be best for everyone.

88
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:57,948
Oh, you mean about Sudo?

89
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,323
The best thing would be to do what you want.

90
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,323
"Do what I want"?

91
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:03,823
That's right.

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,823
If I keep quiet,

93
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,073
I know I'm going to regret it.

94
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,573
Why are you talking to me about this?

95
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:14,948
Your eyes. There's nothing scary in them.

96
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,532
Eyes?

97
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:17,698
Never mind.

98
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,865
It's... hard to...

99
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,407
If you need some advice,

100
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,032
I think Kushida's more versed in this kind of stuff.

101
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:26,282
She showed up for you today.

102
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:30,698
That's interesting.

103
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
I can tell that she's grateful,

104
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,448
but she doesn't seem to fully trust Kushida.

105
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,282
Maybe she's more perceptive than most.

106
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:46,073
You said you'd regret it if
you kept silent about the fight.

107
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,782
Yeah.

108
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,740
Well, I think you already know what to do.

109
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,823
Don't do it for Sudo,

110
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:56,657
or Kushida, or for any of our classmates.

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,782
Push all of those thoughts out of your mind.

112
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,032
They don't serve you.

113
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,948
Serve me? What do you mean by that?

114
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,990
Thinking that way will only convolute things

115
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,990
and make the choice more difficult.

116
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:09,990
You should trust your instincts,
and testify for your sake alone.

117
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,573
You mean do the right thing... for me?

118
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,490
That's motivation enough.

119
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,365
Sorry for taking so long in there!

120
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,823
Oh. Welcome back.

121
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,157
All right. Do you guys think

122
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,782
that we should call it a day now?

123
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,240
It is getting pretty late.

124
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,865
You're right. Hey, would you mind terribly

125
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,407
if I swung by your room a little later tonight?

126
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,740
Huh?

127
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,698
Thanks for having me!

128
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,907
You just had to come to my room?

129
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,740
What's this about?

130
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:44,990
I found some stuff online

131
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,907
that I thought you might be interested to see.

132
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,448
Does this girl look familiar to you?

133
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,573
Hold on. Is that Sakura?

134
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:00,032
It's hard to say if it's her.

135
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,198
I can't tell just from the pictures alone.

136
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,782
But this one was definitely
taken in one of the dorms here.

137
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,573
Do you think it's her, then?

138
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,157
Well, it could be.

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,282
I thought it was strange that
she was wearing fake glasses,

140
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,032
but now it makes perfect sense.

141
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,448
They're fake?

142
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:16,615
There was no distortion behind the lenses.

143
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:19,282
So you think she's wearing them to disguise her face?

144
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,407
Could that be why she didn't want to testify?

145
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,365
It's a message from Sakura.

146
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,198
Let's see here...

147
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,282
You're not gonna believe this.

148
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,615
She might be willing to help us defend Sudo!

149
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:34,698
I guess going with her today was worth it.

150
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:39,198
I'm glad she decided she could trust us, but I wonder why.

151
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:43,115
Hey.

152
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,198
Ayanokoji, are you sure you're not trying

153
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:48,657
to hide anything from me? For real.

154
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,657
I've sent out the notification.

155
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,573
All in classes C and D were invited.

156
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,990
The arbitration hearing is set to take place tomorrow.

157
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,948
Is that so?

158
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,615
Class D.

159
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:12,740
Uh?

160
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:14,073
What's wrong?

161
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,740
Did you spend your entire day off with Kushida?

162
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,157
Yeah, because of the thing with Sakura.

163
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,490
Though we couldn't get her to commit to testifying.

164
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,282
Not definitively.

165
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,448
I see.

166
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,782
What's the matter with you?

167
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,698
What do you mean, "What's the matter?"

168
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:29,282
Well... You are epitomizing

169
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:30,782
"that-face" at the moment.

170
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:33,740
Really? And what do you mean by "that face"?

171
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,240
This is just my face.

172
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,782
Although...

173
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,365
I am amazed at how self-serving
you've been acting recently.

174
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,323
You hesitate when I ask for a favor,

175
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:44,282
but when Kushida does, you gladly jump for her.

176
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:46,490
I'm analyzing, rationally, and precisely,

177
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,907
what factors account for the disparity.

178
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:53,240
Doesn't matter.

179
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:54,657
Could've fooled me.

180
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,990
More importantly. The student council has

181
00:09:57,073 --> 00:10:00,032
decided on the time of Sudo's arbitration hearing.

182
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:01,740
When is it?

183
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,865
It's today, after school.

184
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:08,032
We will now begin the deliberation proceedings

185
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:11,115
regarding the violent incident that occurred last Tuesday.

186
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,657
Your presence is appreciated.

187
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,990
Now, first of all,

188
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,157
I will preside today, as Student Council Secretary.

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,698
The student council president,

190
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,615
attending arbitration over a
little brawl such as this one?

191
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:24,615
I never dreamed I would see this day.

192
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:27,073
My extremely busy schedule often prevents me from

193
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:30,532
being present at proceedings I would prefer to join.

194
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,407
As a rule, though, I try to attend.

195
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,740
Oh, of course. A coincidence.

196
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,198
Indeed...

197
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:40,032
Horikita wasn't expecting

198
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,698
her brother to be here.

199
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:45,865
It seems like his presence might throw off her game.

200
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:49,532
Let's begin. The object here is to ascertain the truth.

201
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,323
Which version of the events is factual.

202
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:53,740
Is that acceptable, sir?

203
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,323
Yes, you may proceed.

204
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,573
Komiya et al, you allege that Sudo summoned you to

205
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,365
the special annex last Tuesday,
where he then attacked you.

206
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,948
Sudo denies your claim.

207
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:07,198
He insists that Komiya summoned him to the annex.

208
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,865
Your versions of these events are contradictory.

209
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:12,240
We can be certain of only one thing.

210
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,323
Sudo attacked and injured you three.

211
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,782
Komiya, Kondo, and Ishizaki are the victims here,

212
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:19,532
and we will proceed under the agreement

213
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,407
that they are the plaintiffs.

214
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,032
Sudo's the defendant in this case.

215
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,198
I'll admit that I beat them up!

216
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,532
But these jerks are the real attackers!

217
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,323
Putting the focus on their injuries

218
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,823
and giving Sudo free reign here

219
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,448
will do nothing but harm our case.

220
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,115
Horikita.

221
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:37,407
...you're jealous that I got

222
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,740
bumped up to first string!

223
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,782
You always try to sabotage me at practice, but it--

224
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,948
Silence, please. Return to your seat.

225
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:45,032
Without any new evidence or testimony,

226
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,323
we will proceed under the aforementioned assumptions.

227
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,282
Is this acceptable?

228
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,115
It's quite apparent

229
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,198
there was no need for adjudication.

230
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:03,032
Judging by the severity of the plaintiffs' conditions,

231
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:05,740
it's clear that the violence was one-sided.

232
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,657
I believe this is sufficient evidence

233
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,615
to allow me to make my decision.

234
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:12,240
Class D's self-defense claim lacks credibility

235
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,740
due to Sudo's absence of injuries. And the plaintiffs'...

236
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:22,115
Hey! Stop it!

237
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:23,448
Uh...

238
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,115
Cut it out.

239
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,907
When someone's spacing out,

240
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,115
a strong physical stimulus can often snap them out of it.

241
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:36,240
The stakes are too high for me to do nothing.

242
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,115
...come on! Uh!

243
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:47,115
If you don't start fighting
now, we're going to lose this case.

244
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,615
I beg your pardon.

245
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:57,032
Before we break, I would like to question the witnesses.

246
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,990
Would that be acceptable?

247
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:00,282
President?

248
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:01,407
I will allow it.

249
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,073
The first question.

250
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:09,282
What were the circumstances under which Sudo summoned you?

251
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,532
I need an answer.

252
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:13,240
Uh, when practice was over,

253
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,115
he just said he wanted to talk to me.

254
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,615
I see.

255
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,823
And what was your reasoning for bringing Ishizaki with you

256
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:20,240
to the special annex?

257
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:22,657
He's not on the basketball team, as far as I know.

258
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,698
There was no reason for him to be present.

259
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:27,407
I brought him 'cause I wanted extra protection.

260
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,907
Protection?

261
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,948
Everyone in school knows what a violent guy Sudo can be.

262
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:33,573
And he's pretty big, too!

263
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:34,782
So you're saying you thought

264
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,532
he might attack you, right?

265
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,823
That's right!

266
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,323
That sounds like a studied response.

267
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,157
If I understand, you claim you brought Ishizaki

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,615
as a bodyguard, because of his reputation as a fighter?

269
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,948
Yeah, I did it to protect myself!

270
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,448
Understood.

271
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,907
I have some knowledge of
martial arts, as a matter of fact.

272
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,907
Sudo faced multiple adversaries

273
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,823
which is exponentially more difficult to do.

274
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:59,657
For him to beat you so soundly,

275
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,490
especially with Ishizaki at your back

276
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,407
defending you, doesn't quite add up.

277
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,365
Uh! It does!

278
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:07,990
He only beat us because we
didn't want to get into a fight!

279
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:09,282
If you didn't want a fight,

280
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,448
why would you go, knowing Sudo's propensities?

281
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,032
And if you weren't fighting back,

282
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,490
how would all three of you end
up with such severe injuries?

283
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:18,115
Common sense tells me Horikita has a good point.

284
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,282
You can't use common sense with Sudo!

285
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:22,115
He doesn't operate that way!

286
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:24,198
He's a violent, unpredictable psychopath!

287
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,448
Well, you're in luck,

288
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,365
because someone witnessed the entire fight.

289
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,240
Would the witness please step forward?

290
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,823
Welcome, Miss.

291
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:45,365
Would you state your name, for the record?

292
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:48,532
Yes. Airi Sakura.

293
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,448
I'm from Class One-D.

294
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:53,157
Please take a seat, Miss Sakura.

295
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,615
Okay...

296
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,782
Sakura.

297
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:05,782
I did see it. I witnessed the whole thing.

298
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:08,115
Sudo has been telling the truth this whole time.

299
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,032
The Class C students attacked him first, like he said.

300
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:13,573
I'm sure of it. They're lying.

301
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,907
Your name's Sakura, is it not?

302
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,073
If you did see the fight, then why didn't you come forward

303
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:20,657
with your knowledge before this point?

304
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,198
Well, you see... Because...

305
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:27,948
Honestly, Class D students are all the same.

306
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,073
I promise this is the truth.

307
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,782
I'm not lying, I swear.

308
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,323
Oh, Sakura. Miss Airi Sakura.

309
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,740
Let's be honest now.

310
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:38,782
Are you sure they haven't coerced you?

311
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:41,948
The stakes are high, and they'd do anything to save Sudo.

312
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:44,532
This could go badly.

313
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,115
Spin it how you wish.

314
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,282
The fact that she's here proves
that she witnessed the fight.

315
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,990
I mean, think about it.

316
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,115
If she hadn't, why would she show up today,

317
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,240
even if we tried to coerce her?

318
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,573
Oh?

319
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,740
If all we needed was someone who'd lie,

320
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,740
why would we choose a girl like
Sakura, who hates to speak up?

321
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,407
Perhaps to lend an air of credibility to your case,

322
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,990
you specifically chose someone who is well-behaved.

323
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,532
That's all you've got?

324
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,573
You're the ones with the burden of proof,

325
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:10,948
and from where I sit, the facts--

326
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,365
It's immoral of you to take advantage of this girl.

327
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,823
She's weak-willed, so you manipulate her.

328
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,657
That is not what's going on!

329
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,073
Just look at how hard she's trembling over there!

330
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:21,490
You put such a burden on her.

331
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,948
I have real proof!

332
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:27,240
I saw the fight. I'll prove it.

333
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,573
You are only digging yourselves a deeper hole.

334
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,032
Here it is.

335
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,448
The proof that I was there. In the annex last Tuesday.

336
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,282
See for yourself.

337
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,407
Let's see it.

338
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,740
Yes.

339
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,032
I was there that afternoon,

340
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,907
looking for a place to take pictures.

341
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,448
I don't like to take them around people,

342
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:54,115
and I knew the annex would be empty.

343
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,032
The photo is dated, too.

344
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,948
Dates on digital photos are relatively simple to alter,

345
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,823
Miss Sakura. Your proof is rather insubstantial.

346
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,948
Just a minute, Mr. Sakagami.

347
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,573
This photo is sufficient proof after all.

348
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,532
Hm? Ah.

349
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,907
Thank you, sir.

350
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,907
I hope this one will be proof enough.

351
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,073
I told you that I was telling the truth.

352
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,532
Thank you so much, Sakura.

353
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:28,948
I'll grant you that much.

354
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,907
It seems that you were indeed present

355
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,323
in the special annex on the day in question.

356
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:35,365
But your photo still does nothing to prove

357
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,198
that Sudo didn't start the fight.

358
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,698
It also doesn't provide evidence

359
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,948
that you really witnessed everything that happened.

360
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:42,698
But I did.

361
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,865
So then, I propose a compromise.

362
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,990
A compromise? What kind?

363
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,782
Despite the "evidence" you provided,

364
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,657
you still don't have any definitive proof.

365
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,240
However, it appears that Class C may indeed

366
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,573
bear some responsibility in this debacle.

367
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,490
I recommend a two-week suspension for Sudo.

368
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:04,365
And a one-week suspension for the Class-C students.

369
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:05,990
Is that acceptable?

370
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,990
The difference in length is commensurate

371
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,407
to the severity in harm done to each party.

372
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,240
If Sakura hadn't come forward with her testimony,

373
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,490
Sudo would have been suspended
for a month, at the very least.

374
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:21,490
It is a good bargain, actually.

375
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:25,282
Ms. Chabashira, does that idea sound satisfactory to you?

376
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:30,115
It would appear we have reached
an agreement that will suffice.

377
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:33,490
Sakura, you did everything you could.

378
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,657
Then, that's it.

379
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,532
Miss Horikita, as representative of Class D,

380
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:46,157
what's your opinion of the agreement?

381
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,157
This is my final word.

382
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,907
Sudo has a problem.

383
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,198
I think he contributed to this, ultimately.

384
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:55,032
Even if he's not the one who threw the first punch.

385
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:57,282
He has no sense of how he affects others.

386
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:00,448
Actions have consequences, but he doesn't see that.

387
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,240
Incidents like this will not stop.

388
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,573
What?!

389
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,365
You need to see the truth of the matter.

390
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,823
Your poor attitude is what started all of this, really.

391
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,948
He does need to reflect on his actions.

392
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:14,365
But not the missteps you claim
he took in fight last Tuesday.

393
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:16,990
I mean that he should reevaluate the person he has been

394
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,698
this whole school year.

395
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,157
Horikita?

396
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,365
In regards to the incident we're discussing right now,

397
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:23,865
that's different.

398
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:27,032
I truly believe Sudo is free of all guilt in the matter.

399
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,490
The truth is, I know that Sudo

400
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,782
didn't stumble into that fight of his own accord.

401
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:38,865
This was a premeditated set-up, instigated by Class C,

402
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:41,448
and that is truly heinous.

403
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,282
I will not back down.

404
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:45,823
I assert that he is innocent.

405
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,490
Premeditated set-up?

406
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,615
That's hilarious, young lady.

407
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:53,948
I think the president's sister is a--

408
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:55,823
As the witness testified earlier,

409
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,032
Sudo's not guilty in this.

410
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,948
I implore you to make the appropriate decision.

411
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,240
We've been victimized by him! He's guilty!

412
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:05,198
You shut your mouth! Jerk!

413
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,365
I'm innocent, and all of you know it!

414
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:08,907
You're just trying to sabotage me

415
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,198
and usurp my place on the team...!

416
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,865
Just as I predicted.

417
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:14,198
This hearing was a waste of everyone's time.

418
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:17,157
I'm appalled at the pathetic
behavior on display right now.

419
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Nothing can be settled unless the liars come forward.

420
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,240
I agree. This is pointless.

421
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:24,282
Therefore, I ask you, Class C.

422
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,448
Can you honestly say right now that the statements

423
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:29,115
you've made today are the unadulterated truth?

424
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,157
What? Of course they're true!

425
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,115
What about Class D?

426
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:33,948
Certainly.

427
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,407
Very well, then.

428
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,782
I will announce my decision tomorrow at four o'clock.

429
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,782
If I receive no amended statements,

430
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,198
as in admission of guilt,

431
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,782
nor proof of your opponents' guilt by then,

432
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:47,782
I will be putting expulsion on the table as well.

433
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,365
That is all.

434
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,282
Do we have a chance?

435
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:59,532
Well, I don't intend to lose, and I never give up, either.

436
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,532
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,032
I should have just spoken up

438
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,782
from the very beginning about what I saw.

439
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,657
I'm not... I'm not brave.

440
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,948
You did just fine. It's okay.

441
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:13,823
But it's not!

442
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:21,615
Why are you two still here?

443
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,448
When you showed up with Suzune today,

444
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,157
I assumed you had a strategy.

445
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,198
But, I suppose I grossly overestimated the both of you.

446
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,698
I never claimed to be some star detective,

447
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,948
and I'm not a trial lawyer, either.

448
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,115
So, no, I don't have a strategy.

449
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,282
You mean Suzune went out on a limb today?

450
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,323
She truly believes he's innocent?

451
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,907
I guess it's a radical idea.

452
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,490
Interesting.

453
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:45,823
Your name's Sakura, right?

454
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:48,740
Yes.

455
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:52,157
If you can't provide evidence to corroborate your claims,

456
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,407
they're nothing but lies,

457
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,615
and your mask will become your prison.

458
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:58,907
But... It's not a lie.

459
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,032
I swear. I was telling the truth.

460
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,990
I believe every word.

461
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:10,823
I see. Well, in that case...

462
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:22,823
Do you have what it takes to prove her right?

463
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,073
I guess you'll find out tomorrow.
