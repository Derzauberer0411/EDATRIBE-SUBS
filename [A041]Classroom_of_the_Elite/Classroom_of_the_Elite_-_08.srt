1
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,248
Earth and water might impede us

2
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:19,415
in our escape from this wretched labyrinth prison.

3
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:21,123
But, the sky is free!

4
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:23,290
You see, even in the darkest depths,

5
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:26,206
there remains a glimmer of hope.

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,665
Oh, Father.

7
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:30,081
You've built such splendid wings.

8
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,415
But will they carry my weight?

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,581
Can I soar freely?

10
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:37,456
Above everything?

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,998
My Icarus. You must listen to me.

12
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:44,831
Freedom can addle the mind, bring delusions and fears,

13
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,665
and arrogance can lead one to death.

14
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,373
Even the birds fly with...

15
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:54,165
Now, this is an egregious waste of tax dollars.

16
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:57,498
A few days ago, a man, whose name I won't mention to you,

17
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:59,415
contacted the school.

18
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:03,790
"You must expel Kiyotaka Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

19
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:06,790
Well now, I wonder what his angle might have been.

20
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:09,456
I hope I'm not supposed to know who it was.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,165
But we both know you can't expel me

22
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:12,956
without good reason.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,290
You're right.

24
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:16,456
As long as you remain a student at this school,

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,456
the rules protect you from that injustice.

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,623
Of course, if you were to cause any trouble...

27
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:25,665
That's a different matter altogether.

28
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,206
Watch me, Father!

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,706
Sorry to inform you.

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,581
But, unlike our arrogant hero, Icarus.

31
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:35,706
I do not intend to challenge the sun.

32
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,165
The sun. It's so near!

33
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:39,831
Your intentions are irrelevant in this case.

34
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,331
If I decide that you've become a problem,

35
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:44,540
then a problem is what you are.

36
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:47,915
Is that a threat? Because it sounds like one.

37
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,873
Not a threat; it's a trade.

38
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,290
If you don't wanna get expelled,
then try to ascend to Class A.

39
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,873
And as long as you do your best,

40
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:57,456
I will cover for you, unilaterally.

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,831
A good deal by anyone's standards.

42
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,206
Icarus!

43
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,623
Maybe, but I'm not going to take it.

44
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,623
In that case, Ayanokoji.

45
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,706
You're going to lose all of your freedom.

46
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,915
You're going to be expelled.

47
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,831
Gods of Olympus.

48
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:22,206
I beg of you, put a curse upon me!

49
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,706
How dare you.

50
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,956
You call yourself a teacher?

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,873
It would be wise to make your decision with haste.

52
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:33,540
Will you try to make it to
Class A, or will you get expelled?

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,540
Curse me! I beg of you!

54
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,706
Trying to manipulate me is not gonna work.

55
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,290
You're going to regret your actions.

56
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,165
Don't worry about me.

57
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,040
My life is so filled with regrets

58
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,415
that one more won't hurt.

59
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:08,248
Throw away my freedom,

60
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,081
to protect my freedom?

61
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,540
The eternal summer ocean!

62
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:54,373
The wide blue yonder!

63
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:56,998
On a ship, in the middle of the Pacific!

64
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:02,290
Now this is what I call cruise paradise!

65
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,998
Look at that view!

66
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,248
Makes your heart race and steals your breath, doesn't it?

67
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,456
It truly is an incredible sight!

68
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,915
Aren't you glad you didn't get expelled after all?

69
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:13,790
Yeah. This trip feels like a dream.

70
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,248
I can't believe we go to a school

71
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,581
that's so generous they take us on a nice cruise

72
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:18,873
for no reason at all!

73
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,415
Yeah!

74
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:28,290
The luxury cruise ship <i>Speranza</i> .

75
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,498
Onboard, you'll find a four-star restaurant.

76
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,248
A live theatre venue.

77
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:39,706
Pools and other various amusement facilities.

78
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,248
There's even a first-class spa.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,331
If I were to purchase a ticket

80
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:46,998
as a private citizen,

81
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,165
it would cost me a few hundred thousand.

82
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,498
Wow!

83
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,915
We can borrow any of these cute swimsuits for free?

84
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:54,498
Hey, Kikyo!

85
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,706
Wouldn't this bikini look so fierce on you?

86
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,956
Um, it's a little revealing, don't you think?

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,665
Aw, come on, we're on vacation.

88
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,415
Live a little!

89
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:06,998
Heads up, Kikyo! Coming at ya now!

90
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,498
Got it!

91
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,331
I'm doing it.

92
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,581
I'm finally gonna tell Kushida how I feel!

93
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:22,331
What?! A-Are you serious?

94
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:28,415
If I don't, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

95
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:29,915
Can't have that.

96
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,331
Ike.

97
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,915
Go do it, then.

98
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,498
Okay! Here goes nothin'!

99
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,415
So, what is it? You okay?

100
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,873
I was wondering.

101
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,415
Hm?

102
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,665
May...

103
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:52,498
May... May... May...

104
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,040
May I please have the extreme honor

105
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,206
of calling you by your given name?

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,290
Well. Please don't keep me waiting.

107
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:02,998
Would you allow me to call you Kikyo?

108
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,915
Yes, but only if you allow me
to call you Kanji, in return!

109
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,915
Uh, Kanji?

110
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:18,290
Kikyo! Kikyo!

111
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,915
Kanji, please!

112
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,790
Whaddaya know. He pulled it off.

113
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,665
All he did was call her by her first name.

114
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,623
Ayanokoji!

115
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:29,206
You've got to tell me Horikita's given name!

116
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,456
Huh?

117
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,915
Tell me Horikita's first name right this second,

118
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,165
or I'll go crazy!

119
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:34,790
I think it's Suzune.

120
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:38,956
Suzune. It's beautiful. Lovely.

121
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,165
All right!

122
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:42,790
I'm gonna go find her and call her Suzune.

123
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,623
Hi, Suzune.

124
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,665
Suzune, can you talk for a sec?

125
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,290
Suzune, you wanna take a walk with me?

126
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:56,540
Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi.

127
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,331
What is their problem? This is weird.

128
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,498
Heh. I'm beautiful.

129
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,581
Whoa, is this place free to everyone, too?

130
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,915
Do ya think they would send us a bill for it later?

131
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,290
Well, people from all the other classes are eating,

132
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,831
so it's probably fine.

133
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,456
I think we should go somewhere else.

134
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,165
Okay, where should we go?

135
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:29,373
Welcome.

136
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:32,040
Would you gentlemen like a table for four?

137
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:33,498
Uh. Sure.

138
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,915
Hey, what kind of food is this, anyway.

139
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:39,831
Look, they have French: "Fro-mage de teh-teh?"

140
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,748
With a delicate, aromatic herb reduction?

141
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,498
Look. No worries.

142
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,498
Let's just order whatever, 'kay? Hey, over here!

143
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:48,456
S'cuse me!

144
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,123
Can we order some food already?

145
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,165
Hey, dudes!

146
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,373
Let's get out of here.

147
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:55,123
You're all from Class D, aren't you?

148
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,498
Yeah. And what about it, buddy?

149
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,123
A bit of advice.

150
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,373
This fine establishment isn't
intended for garbage like you.

151
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:03,581
What?!

152
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,706
Trashy people should be eating trashy food.

153
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,581
Get yourselves some burgers and fries.

154
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,248
What the hell do you have against burgers,

155
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:11,498
you little punk!

156
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,123
Yahiko.

157
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:17,081
Cease with these ridiculous provocations now.

158
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,956
But, Katsuragi...

159
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,081
Despite the fact that we're on vacation,

160
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,790
we could still lose points for unsavory behavior.

161
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:26,706
Please conduct yourself in a manner

162
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,623
befitting a Class A student.

163
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:30,498
Uh. Yes, sir.

164
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,790
You lot would also do well to mind your manners,

165
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,456
and stop being a nuisance to those around you.

166
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,290
Huh? What did we do, exactly?

167
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:39,790
Isn't that Ken Sudo?

168
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:40,915
Uh--

169
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:41,790
He's the one who assaulted

170
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,581
those poor guys from Class B.

171
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,623
He's got crazy eyes!

172
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,623
I hear he's actually killed people.

173
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:48,540
Really?

174
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:49,873
Gimme a break, you guys!

175
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,081
Repeating your mistakes?

176
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,831
Do you intend to get yourself into trouble again?

177
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:58,248
Don't get worked up. Let's go.

178
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:04,790
Katsuragi, from Class A.

179
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,456
Yeah, there we go.

180
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,290
Um, Ms. Hoshinomiya?

181
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,373
Sorry, sorry. Go on.

182
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:22,915
You were saying?

183
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,248
I think Sakayanagi and Katsuragi from Class A,

184
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:27,748
and also Ryuen from Class C--

185
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,998
they're the ones we should be keeping an eye on.

186
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,373
And what about in Class D?

187
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,873
Well, Horikita and Hirata, for sure.

188
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,540
I feel like there's someone else

189
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,165
from Class D, too, though.

190
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:40,623
I've heard rumors that Koenji

191
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,956
has really good grades, and his athletic abilities

192
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,290
are apparently amazing, but I don't know.

193
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,956
No, it wasn't Koenji.

194
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,831
I know that much.

195
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,748
Are you thinking of Ayanokoji?

196
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:53,165
Yeah! There's something about him.

197
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:58,081
My gut says to watch out. He's on my list for sure.

198
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:00,081
But, Ms. Hoshinomiya, I can't just go on

199
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,456
your gut instincts alone.

200
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,790
You're such a meanie!

201
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:16,248
A few days ago, a man I won't mention,

202
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:18,498
contacted the school.

203
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:23,165
"You must expel Kiyotaka Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

204
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,415
Hirata?

205
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:31,665
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

206
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:32,415
No.

207
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:33,748
Good, I'm glad.

208
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,665
I'm about to go hang out with Karuizawa

209
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,040
and a couple of her friends,

210
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:39,248
so do you wanna come with me?

211
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,081
Karuizawa?

212
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,123
I'll pass, thanks.

213
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,206
I don't really know her, or any of her friends,

214
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,040
now that I actually think about it.

215
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:49,831
This might be a good opportunity.

216
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,915
No better time than the present.

217
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,165
Does he honestly care about my social life

218
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:58,415
that much? Or is it something else?

219
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,581
Ayanokoji.

220
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:05,873
The truth of it is, there's something

221
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:07,790
I wanted to ask you to help me with.

222
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:10,248
You want my help?

223
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,665
Would you be willing to act as a liaison

224
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,206
for me and Horikita?

225
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,915
I think if we want to unite Class D

226
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,456
and make progress,

227
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,956
well, she'll be an integral player in making that happen.

228
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,081
So that's what this is about.

229
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,498
I've heard she's great.

230
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,540
That she's the one who proved Sudo's innocence,

231
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:28,331
and that was no small feat.

232
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,498
If we could work togeth--

233
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,206
Shouldn't you answer that?

234
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,373
Sorry. I guess I'd better get going.

235
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,498
If you change your mind and wanna join,

236
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,665
just call me and I'll let you know where we are.

237
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:44,956
I'll do that.

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,206
Cool, later, then.

239
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,915
Hello?

240
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,248
Sorry. I'm on my way.

241
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,873
Sir! Please wait!

242
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,456
We'd prefer that you dry off before

243
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,373
walking on the carpet if you don't mind!

244
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:58,331
Sorry to break protocol,

245
00:12:58,415 --> 00:12:59,956
but I've never toweled off after swimming

246
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,123
in my entire life.

247
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:04,456
Sir, please listen to me!

248
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,331
So, would you say that I am,

249
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:09,331
"dripping with beauty" or "manliness"?

250
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,706
Beautiful!

251
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,748
Sir, I'm begging you!

252
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,706
This is exactly what I deserve.

253
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,873
You sure got here quickly.

254
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,373
I did. What did you summon me for?

255
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:49,873
To ask you a question.

256
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:53,581
Do you believe they'd just give us a holiday?

257
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,665
I'm sure there's some kind of catch.

258
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,248
Go on.

259
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,206
I think we're heading to an island.

260
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,956
The school owns it, and there's a boarding house

261
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,498
on it big enough for all the first-years.

262
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,748
When we get there...

263
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,831
We can't let our guard down for a minute.

264
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,290
They're watching us.

265
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,373
It would appear that I have found you at last.

266
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:18,540
You set up decoy cameras in the special annex.

267
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,540
That was a clever little prank you pulled, missy.

268
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:23,040
Sorry, I don't know who you are.

269
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,831
There's a special place in my heart

270
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,248
for women like you, Suzune.

271
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:30,873
I don't know how you accessed that information,

272
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,498
but I've never given you permission to use my given name.

273
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,248
That's a nice expression.

274
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,831
I think it's incredibly sexy.

275
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,415
Like I said, I don't know you, and I don't want to.

276
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:43,831
I find your presence repulsive at best.

277
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,790
I'm just one of your devoted fans.

278
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,498
How dare you!

279
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,915
Next time, I'll deal with you personally.

280
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:55,040
I'm so looking forward to it.

281
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,415
Ryuen!

282
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:58,998
Oh, Ibuki, it's you.

283
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,248
I need to have a talk with you right now.

284
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,206
Heh, heh.

285
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,790
Missed me so much you had to see me?

286
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,331
Don't be ridiculous!

287
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:08,831
I'm fed up with the way you operate,

288
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:09,998
and I won't stand for it!

289
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,623
I see. That's all right.

290
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,915
We can talk about it later in my room.

291
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,915
Just you and me.

292
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,498
Albert!

293
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,623
You're going along with this?

294
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,540
I see you've officially become Ryuen's guard dog.

295
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,040
Get back here right now, Ryuen!

296
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,915
I'm not finished talking to you!

297
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:40,373
Let me go!

298
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,081
That's enough.

299
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,665
Hey. Are you okay?

300
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,248
It's none of your damn business.

301
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:03,623
Class C seems to be on the verge of collapse.

302
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,040
That's my full report.

303
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,873
I hope it's enough.

304
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,040
Thank you for all of your

305
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:15,748
thorough and diligent work, Ms. Masumi.

306
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,915
What should I focus on now?

307
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,415
Good question.

308
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:23,498
I want you to investigate some students.

309
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,123
Which ones?

310
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:31,123
That's check.

311
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,540
So that's what I've been thinking.

312
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,206
How do you feel?

313
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,998
Um, would you ever want, well, um, want to d--

314
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,415
d-date--

315
00:16:58,498 --> 00:16:58,998
Sakura?

316
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:01,998
What's wrong?

317
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,665
Um. Hi. Uh.

318
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:05,248
How long have you been standing there?

319
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,748
I literally just got here.

320
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:07,956
Did you...

321
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,581
Did you hear what I said before you spoke?

322
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:11,290
No.

323
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,706
Thank goodness.

324
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,748
Why?

325
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,540
Oh, um, I just...

326
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:18,873
Uh...

327
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,248
Is something going on with you?

328
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,623
No! No.

329
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:24,623
Nothing bad is going on with me, exactly.

330
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:26,998
But I'm having trouble making conversation

331
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,331
with our other classmates.

332
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:33,915
So, I'm sorry for asking for your help with it.

333
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,248
Don't be sorry.

334
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:37,998
If you just need someone to listen,

335
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:40,123
that's something I'm happy to do.

336
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:45,040
Thank you so much!

337
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:46,373
Sure.

338
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,748
It's not like it's that big of a deal.

339
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:51,248
Huh? Is that Ayanokoji and Sakura?

340
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,373
See you later.

341
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm going back to my room.

342
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:57,956
Wait, come back!

343
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,123
I wanted to say hi, but I should have left you two alone.

345
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,456
'S cool.

346
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,290
I guess Sakura still hasn't overcome

347
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,998
her fear of strangers.

348
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:13,290
What a beautiful, starry sky!

349
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:16,748
Right? It's pretty. Don't you think so?

350
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,748
When Kushida displays behavior like this,

351
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,248
it's easy to forget.

352
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,581
She was like a different person that night.

353
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:28,331
Well, I'd better get back to my room.

354
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,498
Are you done for the night already?

355
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,248
Yeah, I'm gettin' very sleepy.

356
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,665
Sounds good.

357
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,915
I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then.

358
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,248
Have a good night!

359
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,331
Yeah, thanks, same to you.

360
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,540
Hold on.

361
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:52,748
Kushida?

362
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,248
You're wary of me now, aren't you?

363
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,706
I knew you were.

364
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,665
I can always sense that sort of thing.

365
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:09,998
Sorry.

366
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:15,040
When people leave me all by myself, I get kind of lonely.

367
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:17,498
I thought that maybe you were...

368
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,331
Never mind, it's nothing.

369
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,790
Forget about it!

370
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,540
Good morning, students!

371
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:49,248
Time to rise and shine!

372
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:52,665
Our island destination will soon be in view!

373
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,540
We hope you'll take a few minutes to bask

374
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,331
in the sight of this highly significant scenery.

375
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,331
Don't let the moment pass you by!

376
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,790
Significant scenery?

377
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:06,415
Dang! Get a load of it!

378
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:13,206
Good morning! Isn't this so exciting?

379
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah. Good morning.

380
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:19,081
It's simply breathtaking.

381
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:22,331
Don't you think it's beautiful, too, Ayanokoji?

382
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:24,331
The usual Kushida.

383
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,623
By the way, have you seen Horikita this morning?

384
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:27,498
Why ask?

385
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,373
I thought she would be with you.

386
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:30,623
I haven't.

387
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,165
She doesn't quite seem like the type

388
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:33,748
to revel in a vacation.

389
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:35,498
So she's probably in her room.

390
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,290
I bet you're right.

391
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,248
As we make preparations to disembark on the island.

392
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,915
We'll brief you on what you can expect

393
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,081
once we dock.

394
00:20:58,165 --> 00:20:59,998
Until then, you're required to wait here.

395
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:03,123
It's so hot. I wish they'd speed things up.

396
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,373
Have you been in your room?

397
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:07,040
Yes. I was reading, what of it?

398
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,373
It was extremely engaging, too.

399
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,665
But, since we're not allowed to bring

400
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:15,040
our personal belongings, I won't get to finish.

401
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,415
Anyway, what is this?

402
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,706
We'll confiscate your student IDs.

403
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,165
In their place, you will wear these wristwatches.

404
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,998
Those who take them off without permission

405
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,790
will be severely penalized.

406
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:29,040
They're all acting especially cautious.

407
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,956
Like they're on high alert.

408
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,415
I agree.

409
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,248
I can't imagine they'd go this far

410
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:37,290
if we were just here for a little fun on the beach.

411
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,665
I'm Mashima, the instructor for Class A.

412
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:42,248
To begin with, I'd like to express my gratitude

413
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,831
that we all made it to the island.

414
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,540
Almost all of us.

415
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,956
One of you won't be able to join because of an illness,

416
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,748
and that's a real shame.

417
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,456
Without further ado,

418
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,831
I'm glad to announce the beginning

419
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,331
of this year's special examination.

420
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:00,206
Huh?

421
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,748
Special examination?

422
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,540
The duration of the test is one week.

423
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,748
You'll live as a group on the picturesque

424
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:11,331
desert island you see before you.

425
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,165
You are your own responsibility from here on out,

426
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:17,665
so you're expected to behave accordingly.

427
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:22,456
Now! The test of survival begins!

428
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,790
Looks like vacation's over.
