00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:23,235
Hello, lovely members of Class One-B.

2
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:26,319
Let's all try to have a wonderful day, shall we?

3
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,152
Ew! Teacher, you reek of alcohol!

4
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,735
Yeah, I had a bit too much last night.

5
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:36,610
And now, it's time to announce each class's point totals

6
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,569
for the mont--

7
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:40,694
As for your personal points,

8
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:43,652
those will be distributed to you all tomorrow.

9
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,944
Check it out! Our class points went up!

10
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,360
That's amazing!

11
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,777
Do you think it's because we just aced the midterms?

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,277
I bet your study group brought everyone's scores up!

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,444
No way. It's because you've all worked so hard!

14
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,194
I love you, Ichinose!

15
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:58,194
Whoa, Chihiro! Calm down!

16
00:00:58,277 --> 00:00:59,777
So do I!

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,360
Hey, get off me!

18
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:02,652
You're my hero!

19
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:04,027
Fine.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,277
I'm grateful. I adore being here in Class One-B.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,027
'Cause it's the same class Ichinose's in.

22
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:12,610
I gotta say.

23
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:15,319
I'm also grateful to be in Class One-B.

24
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:16,944
Because even though our homeroom teacher

25
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,610
may be a little eccentric,

26
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:21,360
my classmates are all such wonderful people.

27
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:23,360
And, that's why I'll do my best.

28
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:28,277
I want us all to be in Class
A, and we'll make it together!

29
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:36,527
Uh?

30
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,152
You getting in? Or just standing there?

31
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:43,319
Getting in. Why would I do anything else?

32
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,152
Good morning! How are you doing today?

33
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,069
Looks like you've got some wicked bedhead going on.

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,694
Bedhead is back in style these days, you know.

35
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,860
You're hilarious.

36
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:00,402
You can always crack me up.

37
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:04,194
Understand? If you betray me, you'll pay.

38
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:08,485
Well, then, maybe I'll stop
worrying about my bedhead, too!

39
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,444
I have to live in the same dorm as her

40
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:12,402
for the next three years.

41
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:14,610
What's going on here?

42
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:16,944
Seeing you and Kushida standing together is... strange.

43
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:20,194
She was waiting for me outside my door.

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,652
Ah... I was really hoping she would let me

45
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,610
walk to class with her today.

46
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,194
Good morning, Kushida!

47
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,194
Uh? Ichinose!

48
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,527
Whoa, Kushida, is that your new boyfriend?

49
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,235
No, he's just a friend.

50
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,485
I wonder how she really feels about me.

51
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,777
Oh, by the way.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,735
So, in Class D. Did you get your points yet?

53
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,402
There's been something of an issue.

54
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,944
The provision of points to the
first-years has been delayed.

55
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,569
What? Are you kidding me?

56
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,902
Well, are we going to be compensated in some way

57
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,610
for the school's screw up?

58
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,152
Regrettably, there's nothing I can do about that.

59
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,110
Rest assured that when it's fixed,

60
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,902
then you will all get your points.

61
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:44,569
Assuming you still have any by then, of course.

62
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,235
Uh, hey there.

63
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,110
I'm sorry about this.

64
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,985
That's a strange greeting. What's up?

65
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,944
It's just that...

66
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,069
Well, I have to say this.

67
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:18,485
I'm pretty sure...

68
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,527
...someone is about to ask me out!

69
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,277
Like, right now!

70
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,985
Huh? Wait, I'm confused.

71
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,152
Wouldn't it be better if I wasn't here?

72
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:36,027
Well, normally, but I don't know a thing about dating!

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,152
Someone left this in my locker yesterday.

74
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,902
And the feeling is not mutual.

75
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,360
And I have no idea how to let them down easy.

76
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,569
Without hurting them, you know?

77
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:49,402
So, I was wondering if you might help me out

78
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,860
by pretending to be my boyfriend for a sec.

79
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,735
She seriously thinks that's going to work?

80
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,235
I'm begging you!

81
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,402
I think it would be better to just be honest with them

82
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:59,319
and hash it out. That's my advice.

83
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,777
I can't!

84
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,819
Ichinose.

85
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,444
Who is this person?

86
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,402
Uh! Look, I'm really sorry.

87
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,110
I know you don't know this guy,

88
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,694
I wasn't trying to be rude or anything.

89
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:21,194
Um, this is Ayanokoji, and he's in Class One-D.

90
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,360
Is he your boyfriend?

91
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:26,819
You could have told me.

92
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:28,819
Well, Ayanokoji and I...

93
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:29,694
He and I are--

94
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:31,569
Just friends, don't worry.

95
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,985
Ichinose. It's hard to confess your feelings.

96
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,777
It makes you so open and vulnerable.

97
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,652
You spend every day in agony, but you still can't do it.

98
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,485
That's a painful place to be.

99
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,360
The words, "I love you," stick in your throat,

100
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:48,402
and no matter how hard you try, you can't force them out.

101
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:51,152
She was brave, so she deserves an honest answer.

102
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,569
Do you think you can give her that much, at least?

103
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,485
But, it's also not my place to get involved.

104
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,152
Hello, again. Looks like you talked it out.

105
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,444
Yeah.

106
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:31,985
It's funny.

107
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,194
All I could think about was

108
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:35,235
how to get out of hurting her feelings.

109
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,902
But the truth of it is, I was just running away.

110
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,277
We've reached an agreement.

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,944
We're going to try to go back to normal tomorrow.

112
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:45,652
Here's hoping.

113
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
You'll both have to commit to it.

114
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,152
Yeah.

115
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,527
Anyway, sorry.

116
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,902
I put you in an awkward position.

117
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,152
No worries.

118
00:07:57,235 --> 00:08:01,110
I don't mind some weirdness now and then.

119
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:03,985
I guess this means I owe you one, doesn't it?

120
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,235
How intriguing.

121
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm telling you, that's not how it went down!

122
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,277
There were three dudes ganging up on me!

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,735
Yeah, but still.

124
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:33,985
I know.

125
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:36,485
What's all this about?

126
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,819
Hey, Ayanokoji.

127
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,819
I think that something bad might have happened.

128
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,527
Some of the Class C students of the basketball team

129
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,944
have filed a complaint against Sudo.

130
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,527
They say that after practice,

131
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,027
Sudo attacked and injured then without provocation.

132
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,652
They're claiming trauma.

133
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:54,110
That's a load of crap, it was clear self-defense!

134
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:55,944
They're jealous that I play first string,

135
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:58,360
so those jerks decided to pick a damn fight with me!

136
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,235
There's no evidence of that,

137
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,652
but if there were any witnesses
it might be a different story.

138
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,735
Okay! Did any of you happen to see Sudo's fight?

139
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,360
Does anyone know anything about it?

140
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:20,319
Perhaps everyone would be better off

141
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:22,277
if you'd been expelled after all.

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,860
Ginger Boy.

143
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:27,735
And people might defend you, if you were pretty.

144
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:28,819
What?!

145
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,610
Sudo! Calm down.

146
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:32,235
One week from today,

147
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,985
we will all hold a group discussion.

148
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,569
Class C and the Student Council will attend.

149
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,235
Depending on how things go,

150
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,319
you may be asked to forfeit points,

151
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:42,444
and Sudo may face other consequences.

152
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,819
♪♪♪

153
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:59,444
Those poor Class D morons.

154
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:01,610
Probably throwin' a huge fit.

155
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:17,902
Listen, Ryuen.

156
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:21,902
I think somebody might have seen us.

157
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:24,110
When we were fighting with Sudo,

158
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:27,485
I got the feeling someone was watching.

159
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,235
Bad boy.

160
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,110
You look like a proper victim now.

161
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,652
Yes. Thank you, sir, you're always right.

162
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,652
Perform your little dance well. Just like we planned.

163
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,819
This is all Sudo's fault.

164
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,069
It totally sucks.

165
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,777
I don't know how I'll survive another month

166
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,402
living on zero points.

167
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,152
Maybe we really would be better
off if he had gotten expelled.

168
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,152
I hear that for sure.

169
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:15,360
So, do you agree with them?

170
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:18,902
That Sudo should have gotten expelled for failing?

171
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,444
I have no opinion.

172
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,027
But, what are your thoughts on it?

173
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,152
You know, since you're of the
people who helped him stay here.

174
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,569
At the moment, our class has zero points.

175
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,569
Even if we had been penalized
for someone getting expelled,

176
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,694
we'd be no worse off than we are now.

177
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,235
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

178
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:39,194
'Scuse me? I didn't like the way you said that.

179
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,694
You never know when we might be gaining or losing points

180
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:42,819
with no knowledge of it.

181
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,444
What's that supposed to mean?

182
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,277
We don't know any of the rules.

183
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,319
We might be getting negative
marks that we don't know about.

184
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:52,277
Demerits for an expulsion might not hit us right now.

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,194
They might matter later. We have no idea how it works.

186
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:59,152
For example, what if one of the requirements for moving up

187
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,735
to Class A is that none of us have been expelled?

188
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,444
Who can say?

189
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,110
You don't know that.

190
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,735
One of the hallmarks of this school

191
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,902
is that they don't share the rulebook with us.

192
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,402
If we wanna reach Class A, we should play the game like

193
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:16,360
it's life or death, and there are threats at every turn.

194
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,985
Anyway. Sudo is an athlete,

195
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,985
and he's in good standing with the basketball team.

196
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:21,819
That could wind up being useful in the end.

197
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:24,527
Hey, guys! Listen up.

198
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,360
I want to be able to trust my classmates.

199
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:29,819
I think that we should band together to find witnesses

200
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,235
as to what happened with Sudo.

201
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,485
Sure! You can count me in on that.

202
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,527
Well, if you think that's best, Hirata, I'm in.

203
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,069
Yeah, I want to help, too.

204
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,360
If we don't stick up for each other, no one will.

205
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,860
Kushida says it. I do it!

206
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,485
Yeah, me, too!

207
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,819
Hey. You two are going to join us, right?

208
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:47,235
Do you wanna help us help Sudo?

209
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,110
In light of everything you just said,

210
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:52,069
you'll certainly be helping them, won't you, Ayanokoji?

211
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:53,610
You know.

212
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,319
You're the one who wants to
advance to Class A, aren't you?

213
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:59,027
So, that means you're gonna help us? Thanks so much!

214
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,527
Yeah. Guess I have to.

215
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,652
Horikita, are you in?

216
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,652
You and I should work together.

217
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,819
But if we're trying to find witnesses,

218
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:14,152
Sudo should stay out of it.

219
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,652
I think that would probably be best, don't you?

220
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:18,152
I agree.

221
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,652
Involving him would be a conflict of interests.

222
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,319
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,694
Great!

224
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:25,944
I'm going to share our plan with Sudo, personally.

225
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,652
I'll see you after class, then!

226
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,319
I can't believe we couldn't find any clues or witnesses.

227
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,735
I don't know.

228
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:39,069
Have you considered the possibility that Sudo is lying?

229
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,694
Well, I sure have.

230
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,569
What about Hirata's group?

231
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,235
No luck. I texted them,

232
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,152
they didn't find anything, either.

233
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,319
Hey, guys!

234
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:50,652
Ayanokoji! Hey, Kushida!

235
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,819
Oh, it's Ichinose.

236
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,069
Some people in my class told me what's going on.

237
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,569
You guys are holding an investigation, aren't you?

238
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:58,777
Uh...

239
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,069
Got it. So it's the guys from Class C.

240
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,694
Yeah. Please ask around, and if anyone knows something,

241
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,069
be sure to tell us first.

242
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:10,485
Definitely. Sorry I can't help you more than that.

243
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:11,985
I'll tell Class B the whole thing,

244
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,319
and they'll be happy to help you look.

245
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,069
Really? That'd be great--

246
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:17,485
What are you doing?

247
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:20,110
This is probably a plot.

248
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,819
Listen. I don't think it's wise to rely on other classes--

249
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:24,527
Don't worry!

250
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,444
I'm not up to anything weird.

251
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,069
I do owe you one, Ayanokoji, remember?

252
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:32,944
Ready? Fight!

253
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:34,819
Fight! Fight! Fight!

254
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,319
Ready? Fight!

255
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,319
Fight! Fight! Fight!

256
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,777
Ready? Fight!

257
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,735
Fight! Fight! Fight!

258
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,069
Ready? Fight!

259
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:44,777
Fight! Fight! Fight!

260
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,735
Hey, Ayanokoji!

261
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,444
Hey. Did you put up this notice?

262
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,569
Yeah! But it was Kanzaki's idea.

263
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:54,444
We're gathering information through the class's

264
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,735
online message board. Uh.

265
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:58,735
Look, we already received an email!

266
00:14:58,819 --> 00:14:59,985
Oh, what does it say?

267
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,652
Let's see... A character witness

268
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,902
about one of the guys Sudo fought with, Ishizaki.

269
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:08,652
They say this guy was a troublemaker in middle school.

270
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,319
Apparently, he was a good fighter, too,

271
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,569
so everyone in school was afraid of him.

272
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,569
That raises some red flags.

273
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,235
The other guys are on the basketball team,

274
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:17,652
so they're physically fit.

275
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:19,527
It's unlikely Sudo could beat all of them by himself

276
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,652
without getting hurt.

277
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,235
That's a good point.

278
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:25,569
Perhaps they initially wanted to beat him up, but instead,

279
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,485
they decided it would be better to frame him

280
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,944
and get him expelled. It fits the story.

281
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,610
You're right, that's plausible.

282
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,235
Anyway, I should pay whoever sent us the information.

283
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,569
Huh? Wait, it's an anonymous tip.

284
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,027
How am I supposed to reward them, then?

285
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,527
I think I know a way.

286
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,444
Uh? Tell me about it, then!

287
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,569
Her guard's totally down.

288
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,402
Will you loan me your student ID?

289
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:48,860
Of course!

290
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,444
There.

291
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:59,735
There we go! Thanks!

292
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,027
If we collect any more info,

293
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,819
we'll be sure that you're the first to hear!

294
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,027
'Kay.

295
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:15,902
How could one person collect so many points?

296
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:25,819
Hey, everyone.

297
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,110
Oh, welcome back.

298
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,485
Ayanokoji! I decided to get the guys together.

299
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,944
We're having a meeting so we can pool what we've learned.

300
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,110
I gotta say,

301
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,652
I can't believe how empty your room is.

302
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:36,985
Yeah, he's right.

303
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:39,194
You don't really have much of anything in here.

304
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:41,277
You only have the stuff we were provided.

305
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,819
So, Ayanokoji. Are you a minimalist?

306
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,402
No, I'm not. I just don't have extra points to burn.

307
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,610
But all that aside.

308
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:49,235
How did you guys get into my room?

309
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,194
We had copies of your key made!

310
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,569
How did you manage that?

311
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,944
What's wrong, this is our meeting place, right?

312
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,360
Wait, are you implying

313
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:57,902
we shouldn't have done that?

314
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,569
Uh, um... I can give mine back.

315
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,152
Well, we aren't going to, we refuse!

316
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,152
Fine. I don't care.

317
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,194
Uh?

318
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,235
Horikita.

319
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,444
Regarding any witnesses--

320
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,402
I'm leaving.

321
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,360
Hey, Horikita! You decided to come after all?

322
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,777
I think it'd be best for everyone

323
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,360
if you'd share what you know.

324
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:28,319
If you would prefer it, we can stay quiet and just listen.

325
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,110
You've put in a lot of effort with minimal results,

326
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:33,110
so let me offer some intel.

327
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,902
There was a witness.

328
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,319
And, it was someone close.

329
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:39,235
You know who it is?

330
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,360
One of our classmates, Sakura, knows something.

331
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,694
What is it that makes you think Sakura saw anything?

332
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,944
When Kushida made the plea in
class for everyone to help out,

333
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:26,319
pretty much all of our other
classmates turned to face her.

334
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:29,360
Sakura, on the other hand, stared at her desk.

335
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:32,194
She was the only one, so...

336
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,194
No good. She's not answering.

337
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,402
Aw...

338
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,235
Dammit! I was starting to think

339
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,152
we were gonna get somewhere with this chick.

340
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,735
But still.

341
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,444
It doesn't even matter if she
is willing to testify or not.

342
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,944
It's not going to make much of a difference.

343
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:46,860
The question of whether it was self-defense or not

344
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:47,902
is just a minor detail.

345
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,860
In the big picture, it's nothing.

346
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,569
Haven't you guys figured that out?

347
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:54,652
--Huh?! --What do mean by that?

348
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,319
Nothing at all.

349
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,944
Goodbye, now.

350
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,360
Sakura, huh.

351
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:12,610
Honestly, I can't even remember what she looks like.

352
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,069
Mm?

353
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,069
Kushida.

354
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:20,902
I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

355
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,902
I hate to bug you about it, but do you have any idea

356
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,944
what Horikita was talking about earlier today?

357
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:32,110
Even if Sudo was acting in self-defense

358
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:34,569
in the fight, that's not the root of the problem.

359
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,110
It's a bigger issue than just that.

360
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:37,277
Huh?

361
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,735
Sudo is always talking trash

362
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,402
and being aggressive towards people.

363
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,235
He lashes out over nothing.

364
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,110
The way he acts inevitably makes people resent him.

365
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:48,860
He comes off as a jerk pretty much all the time.

366
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:51,777
So, hypothetically, say a murder takes place.

367
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,402
There are two suspects,

368
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,777
one of whom is known to have committed murder in the past.

369
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,277
Now, imagine the other is a moral, law-abiding citizen.

370
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,777
Which one of them would you believe?

371
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,110
I guess I'd believe the law-abiding citizen, honestly.

372
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:08,277
But the truth is that the so-called "good guy"

373
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,694
could be the murderer.

374
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:11,485
Where there is so little evidence, people are inclined

375
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:15,069
to go with what they know from
a person's behavior in the past.

376
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,277
So, you're saying that Sudo

377
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,985
kind of brought this upon himself?

378
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,819
That the way he's acted since school started

379
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,319
led him to this situation?

380
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,277
Yes, and Sudo doesn't get that or think

381
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,027
he's done anything wrong. Look at Horikita.

382
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,194
That's why she won't cooperate with us.

383
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,235
But, I still believe we should make every effort

384
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,902
to help clear Sudo's name.

385
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,194
We wouldn't be good friends if we didn't.

386
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,902
If you think that's the right thing to do,

387
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,360
then follow through with it.

388
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,569
I don't believe that that would be a problem at all.

389
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:44,402
Right. Not to change the subject,

390
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,069
but once again you seem to know everything

391
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,819
about the way Horikita operates in the world.

392
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:51,694
I think that might be going a bit far.

393
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,985
Um. Hey, Ayanokoji.

394
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,194
Do you...

395
00:20:58,277 --> 00:21:00,569
Do you think that...

396
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:04,652
Well, if I... If I were to...

397
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:11,110
No. Never mind.

398
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,902
As far as stuff with Sakura goes,

399
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,235
I'll approach her alone tomorrow and see what she says.

400
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,402
If we all went together,

401
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,527
I think she'd get intimidated and shut up.

402
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,152
See ya later!

403
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,860
Hey, Sakura!

404
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,444
Um, yes?

405
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,235
There's something that I've
been wanting to talk to you about.

406
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,610
Do you have a moment? It's about this thing with Sudo.

407
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:43,152
Um. I'm sorry but I can't right now.

408
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,985
There's somewhere I'm supposed to be.

409
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,235
It's only going to take a moment.

410
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,610
This is important!

411
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,860
No, I wasn't there! I really don't know anything!

412
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,277
Oh! Sorry! Are you okay?

413
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,527
Oh, no. It's not turning on.

414
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,652
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

415
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:08,194
Don't be.

416
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,527
This whole thing was my fault!

417
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,402
Wait, come back!

418
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:17,319
If I get involved,

419
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,194
everyone will find out the truth about me.

420
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:23,569
No one here can ever know.
