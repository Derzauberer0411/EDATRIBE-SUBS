1
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,754
We owe it all to you, Kushida!

2
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:25,337
Yeah, you totally saved our butts on this one!

3
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,712
You guys, it's not like I took the test for you!

4
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,462
You're an angel!

5
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:34,962
Kushida, you must have been
sent from heaven to help us pass!

6
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,921
Ayanokoji.

7
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,296
Be honest. What exactly did you do?

8
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:18,129
Nice serve!

9
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:21,296
You want some? Come and get it!

10
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,421
What, do you think you're in some kind of gangster movie

11
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:24,796
with that thug act?

12
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,212
Man, you're ugly inside and out, you pathetic loser.

13
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:29,879
Say that again, punk!

14
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,337
Kushida asked me to try to get him

15
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:36,087
to come to her study group, but I don't know.

16
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,837
I can't wait to see how many Class D idiots

17
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,254
get expelled after they fail the next test.

18
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,129
I bet I know who will be first.

19
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:03,421
I hope you've said your prayers.

20
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,129
All right, that's enough!

21
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,462
What? Who're you?

22
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,629
Keep your damn nose out of it!

23
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,546
As one of your fellow students, I cannot allow violence

24
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:14,337
to be perpetrated on this campus, understand?

25
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:17,296
If you all insist on continuing to fight anyway,

26
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,962
I'm going to have to call security.

27
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:21,254
Look, Ichinose.

28
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,296
There isn't even a fight to continue.

29
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,004
Sudo's victimizing us.

30
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,296
Is that so?

31
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,629
Well, from where I'm standing,

32
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,337
you certainly don't look like victims to me, Ryuen.

33
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,254
And if you don't cut it out, I'm going to report

34
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,337
every one of you to the administration.

35
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:38,837
Hey, monkey.

36
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,421
You son of a--

37
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:42,837
I think you're going to make a mighty fine plaything.

38
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,254
Hey, punk! You runnin' away?

39
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:47,587
Answer me!

40
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:48,837
I'm talkin' to you!

41
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,587
Relax.

42
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,171
Listen, Sudo.

43
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:56,004
Don't let him get you all wound up like that, okay?

44
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:59,254
Shut your mouth. You don't rule me.

45
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:02,754
Sorry for all the drama, guys! Everything's cool now!

46
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:05,629
Thanks a bunch, Ichinose!

47
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,546
Okay guys, do your best to stay out of trouble.

48
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,421
See ya!

49
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:13,087
Dammit!

50
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,421
Sudo. Are you free for the next hour?

51
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,087
Kushida wants you to come to her study group.

52
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,671
No way. I've got practice.

53
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:25,296
Ike and Yamauchi are both in it.

54
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,546
Hey.

55
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,046
Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?

56
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,796
There's no point in cramming for it now.

57
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,671
I'll take my chances.

58
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,087
Sudo!

59
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,087
What's the matter with you today?

60
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,796
Sorry!

61
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,921
Hey, Sudo.

62
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,046
Can we talk for a minute?

63
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,337
Are you seriously okay

64
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,046
with getting expelled from this school?

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,754
Just get off my back.

66
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,296
So, you'd give it up, then.

67
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,629
Basketball?

68
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,712
I've summarized all the information from class

69
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,212
in this notebook.

70
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:11,337
Just so you know,

71
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:14,296
I'm only doing this for my own
sake. You really should study

72
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,629
for yours, if you know what's good for you.

73
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,962
That way you won't get expelled
and you can keep playing on

74
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:21,254
the basketball team at this school.

75
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:27,462
Ayanokoji. I can't believe you invited me to lunch.

76
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,671
This sure is a first!

77
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,921
Did you want to talk to me about something?

78
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:34,296
Yeah, just promise you won't breathe a word to anyone.

79
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,796
Mm-hm!

80
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,337
Let's go.

81
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,421
Excuse me. Are you an upperclassman?

82
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,421
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji from Class One-D.

83
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,671
You're in the D class for your grade, too, aren't you?

84
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,837
Well, yeah.

85
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,129
The free food selection

86
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:59,129
is pretty abysmal, isn't it?

87
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:00,962
What do you want from me?

88
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,254
I wanna consult with you about something.

89
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:05,587
Don't worry, I will make it worth your while.

90
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,087
About what?

91
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:10,129
Do you still have any of your class's midterm questions

92
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,462
from two years ago?

93
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,046
I want you to hand them over to me.

94
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,962
Why are you asking me, and not the other upperclassmen?

95
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,504
Is it that hard to see?

96
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,629
People like you, who're short on class points,

97
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:22,879
are way more likely to see

98
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,004
the benefit of striking a deal with us.

99
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,421
And don't think I didn't notice
how hard you were struggling

100
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,712
to eat that wild vegetable lunch combo.

101
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,046
How much will you pay?

102
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,712
Ten thousand points.

103
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,254
It's as high as I'll go.

104
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,379
I'd be taking a big risk here, too.

105
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,879
I would need 30,000 at the very least.

106
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,546
I'm afraid that won't work.

107
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,796
Sorry to disappoint.

108
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,504
You can forget making a deal with me, then.

109
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,504
Please reconsider!

110
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,421
We're doing this to prevent a friend of ours from

111
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,879
getting kicked out of school! I'm begging you to help us.

112
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,504
10,000.

113
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:00,712
No, 25.

114
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,171
10,000.

115
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:05,712
20,000.

116
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:09,504
10,000. That's it.

117
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:11,879
15,000.

118
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:14,087
I can't possibly go any lower.

119
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:16,546
I can live with that. You've got a deal.

120
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,296
That is, if you include your quizzes

121
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,587
from the first term as a bonus.

122
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,879
Okay...

123
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,046
I can't ever thank you enough!

124
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:27,879
But, still...

125
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,629
How do you know that it'll be okay?

126
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:30,962
Don't worry about it.

127
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:33,254
This is all well within school rules.

128
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:36,671
I suppose that could be true.
But studying old test questions?

129
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:39,004
That feels an awful lot like cheating.

130
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,087
I disagree with you on that.

131
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:44,421
His reaction to our proposition only confirmed my theory.

132
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,587
Trading old test questions among students is

133
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,921
nothing out of the ordinary at this school.

134
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:51,671
Maybe that's because they're just that: old questions.

135
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:52,837
What if this year's exam

136
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,254
isn't anything like the one from before?

137
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:58,379
The old test may not contain the exact same questions,

138
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:01,546
but I'm willing to bet it'll still cover the same content.

139
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:02,796
You think so?

140
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,421
Try not to worry about it.

141
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:05,879
This is our first line of defense

142
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,171
against Sudo and the others getting expelled.

143
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,879
Here we go. He started with a quiz.

144
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:19,962
It's the same. Identical, down to the letter.

145
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,129
Oh, that's great!

146
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:23,046
So, what does that mean about the midterm?

147
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,546
It'll prob'ly be the same as last years, too.

148
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,087
We should show that to the whole class,

149
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,296
not just the people in danger of failing.

150
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,587
Not yet.

151
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,254
We'll hold off on showing it to them for now.

152
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,671
But, why?

153
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:36,254
Say we show them the questions ahead of time.

154
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:39,046
What do you think they'll do in that knowledge?

155
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,337
They'll memorize all the answers instead of study!

156
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,921
That's precisely it.

157
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,587
Ayanokoji, are you a lot smarter than you let on?

158
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,337
I'd say I'm more cunning than smart.

159
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,712
Hey. Do you think you could do me a favor?

160
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,004
When we do this, can you tell the class

161
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,087
that you're the one who got the questions?

162
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,462
Sure, if you want, but wouldn't you like to get credit

163
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:03,879
for your hard work?

164
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:06,921
I don't like to draw attention to myself unnecessarily.

165
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,504
And anyway.

166
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:12,087
I think our classmates trust
you a little more than they do me.

167
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:13,421
Okay, then.

168
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:15,962
If you're positive that's what you really want.

169
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,462
I appreciate it.

170
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:19,337
Well. I guess this means you and I

171
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,587
have our own little secret, don't we?

172
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,796
Hang on, everyone!

173
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,087
There's something I want you to have

174
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,296
before you leave for the day.

175
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,171
What, test questions?

176
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,171
Did you make these up, or something?

177
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,629
Actually, they're questions that were on

178
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:38,296
the midterm a couple years ago.

179
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,629
I got them last night from one of the third years.

180
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,004
Seriously?

181
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,796
Mm-hm. He told me that the tests have been

182
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,504
pretty much identical for the last couple of years.

183
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,754
So, I bet they'll be helpful

184
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,587
in studying for tomorrow's test, too!

185
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,587
Are you freaking kidding me?!

186
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,004
Heck, I wish I'd had these

187
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:54,879
before I ran myself ragged studying.

188
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,504
This is awesome!

189
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:58,087
Here you go, Koenji!

190
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,629
I beg your pardon, but I don't
need to resort to such tactics.

191
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:04,379
And I've got a hot date tonight, so excuse me.

192
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,046
Have fun with your studying.

193
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,546
Hey, Kushida.

194
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,212
I know things like this might be beneath you,

195
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,421
but I want you to have one, too.

196
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:13,754
Can I ask you a question?

197
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,254
Thanks a million, Kushida!

198
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,046
I shall be forever in your debt!

199
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,712
To be honest, I think the only
reason I might have done okay...

200
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:29,879
I can't say I'm surprised. Kushida plays the role well.

201
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,629
That's an insult.

202
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,046
I must say, I'm impressed with you.

203
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,546
I never imagined you'd be able to bring your scores up

204
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,004
so much on this exam.

205
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,837
I acknowledge that you must have put in the effort.

206
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,546
However...

207
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:53,296
Sudo got a failing grade.

208
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,754
Too bad.

209
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,004
What? You've got to be kidding!

210
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:05,879
How could I possibly have failed?!

211
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,421
The threshold for failure

212
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:10,754
on the midterm exam was 40 points.

213
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,629
The average class test score was 79.6.

214
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:18,712
When I divide that by two

215
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:21,171
then round up to 40 points,

216
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:24,546
I get the minimum score needed to pass.

217
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,796
By less than a point?

218
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,837
We only knew each other for a short time,

219
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,337
and I know you tried.

220
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,754
Your expulsion notice will be issued after class anyway.

221
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:35,171
So, that's it?

222
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,712
I'm getting expelled?

223
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,129
Wait, Miss Chabashira!

224
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:40,337
Is there anything we can do to save him?

225
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,796
A failing score is a failing score.

226
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,587
Are you sure that's the final word?!

227
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,296
We just can't let Sudo get kicked out like this!

228
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,129
It doesn't seem right.

229
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:52,462
Rules exist for a reason. Just get over it.

230
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:58,671
Homeroom is over for today. Sudo, I'll be waiting for you

231
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:01,129
in the faculty office after school.

232
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:11,587
Well, are we just gonna let them do this? It's terrible.

233
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:14,337
Sudo is going to be expelled.

234
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:16,879
Ayanokoji?

235
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:19,171
Sorry. Gotta go to the restroom.

236
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,462
What do you want?

237
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,921
You'll be tardy if you don't head back to class.

238
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:44,254
Yeah, I know.

239
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:45,796
But I have a question.

240
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,421
A burning question.

241
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,796
Make it fast.

242
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,129
Right now, in Japan, do you believe

243
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,212
that our society is equal?

244
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,129
That's quite a question for a boy of your age.

245
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:59,587
But is there any point in my answering it this moment?

246
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,379
It's important to me.

247
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,671
I would appreciate an answer.

248
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:07,921
Well, speaking from my own experience.

249
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:12,421
Our society is definitely not equal. Not in the least.

250
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,296
I'm inclined to agree with you.

251
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,254
The word "equality" is a lie that we're told.

252
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,546
But still. Humans are rational.

253
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,587
We didn't become social beings for no reason.

254
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,671
What are you trying to say?

255
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:27,671
What I'm saying is, for rules to be effective,

256
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:31,087
they have to at least appear
to apply equally to everybody.

257
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:32,546
Huh?!

258
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,421
So, what do you want?

259
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:42,296
Sell me a point on that test, to add to Sudo's score.

260
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,129
You sure are an interesting kid.

261
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:52,337
Do you really expect me to sell you a single test point?

262
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,796
Well, why not?

263
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,129
It goes along with what you told us on the first day.

264
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,296
To make purchases, you will spend points,

265
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,921
which are tracked using the school's computer system.

266
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,379
At this school, you can buy

267
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:05,712
absolutely anything on campus with these.

268
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:08,504
For rules to work, they must be applied across the board,

269
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,379
even when it comes to the midterm.

270
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,879
I see what you mean.

271
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:15,046
Maybe there is something to your little idea after all.

272
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,587
However, that doesn't mean you
can afford that single point.

273
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:19,671
It's quite a lot.

274
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,796
So, give me a number.

275
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,546
Let me see.

276
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,587
If you can cough up 100,000 points,

277
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,296
right here and now, then we'll have an agreement.

278
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,671
That's just cruel, Ms. Chabashira.

279
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,879
That's part of the rules, too.

280
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:35,712
I'll help cover it.

281
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,712
We don't know what the punishment is.

282
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,671
The price for losing one of our classmates might be high.

283
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,837
I've determined that there may be certain advantages

284
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:48,421
to us keeping Sudo around.

285
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:49,421
Horikita.

286
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,921
I thought that you people might keep me on my toes.

287
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,212
Very well then. I'll sell you Sudo's test point.

288
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:02,087
You can tell him you saved him.
He won't be expelled after all.

289
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:03,587
Are you sure about this?

290
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:06,212
You made your case and I agreed.

291
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,462
I couldn't refuse now.

292
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,587
Just so you're aware, never in this school's history

293
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:18,337
has a D class managed to advance.

294
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:20,671
Do you think you'll be the first?

295
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:25,462
I can't speak for him, but I
will ascend to a higher class.

296
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:26,671
Is that so?

297
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,796
And how do defectives such as yourselves,

298
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,712
plan to achieve such a goal?

299
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,629
From what I've seen "defectives" can sometimes be fixed

300
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:37,087
with only the slightest of alterations.

301
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,212
At least in my experience.

302
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:43,796
I can't wait to see how that turns out.

303
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,004
As your teacher, I sincerely hope that you succeed.

304
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,296
Class C is gaining on us.

305
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,087
Looks like Ryuen must be at work again.

306
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,296
He's dangerous for us.

307
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:08,046
Don't you find it all boring?

308
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,712
Class A has 1,004 points.

309
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:18,504
For some perspective, we only have 87 right now.

310
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:21,962
To be honest, becoming Class A feels like a pipe dream.

311
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,504
I'm not going to give up.

312
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:27,421
I will advance to Class A, no matter what.

313
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:28,504
If you say so.

314
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,421
What's that?

315
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,212
Well. I definitely owe ya one.

316
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:35,296
Thanks for jumping in to help me save Sudo.

317
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:36,796
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,129
I did that to benefit myself and for no other purpose.

319
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,296
Hm... Is that really the only reason?

320
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,171
What are you talking about?

321
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,754
I think you care more than you let on.

322
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:50,046
You knew Sudo would get a borderline score

323
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:51,629
on the English midterm.

324
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,837
So you intentionally lowered your score.

325
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,796
That's a very nice thing to do for someone

326
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,046
you once fought with.

327
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,046
Wonder why you changed your mind about him.

328
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,046
I told you, I only did it to help us advance to Class A.

329
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,462
Yeah, okay.

330
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,129
Just keep tellin' yourself that.

331
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:09,171
Hey. You've got an attitude.

332
00:17:09,254 --> 00:17:12,296
I don't like it very much, Ayanokoji.

333
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,754
Uh...

334
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,379
You'll regret it if it causes you to suffer,

335
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:20,046
or you'll regret it if you feel despair.

336
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:23,212
Which of the above experiences would you prefer?

337
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:26,421
Well, if it's up to me, I think I'll take "neither."

338
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,587
But what's she doing with that compass?

339
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,504
Ouch.

340
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,337
Cheers!

341
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,254
Hey! Why the long face, man?

342
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,879
I have no objections to the fact that we're celebrating,

343
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,087
and I'm glad to be a part of it.

344
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:46,254
But why does it have to be in my room?

345
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:48,629
Man, that was a close call, am I right?

346
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:51,087
If Kushida hadn't gotten those old test questions,

347
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:55,004
Ike and Sudo would be long
gone by now, you know what I mean?

348
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,504
Hey. You just barely squeaked by, too, y'know.

349
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,587
I just haven't gotten my act together yet.

350
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,837
Sudo, how did you manage to fail...

351
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:03,087
Hey, Ayanokoji!

352
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,837
What is it?

353
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,129
How were you able to get them

354
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:08,712
to take back Sudo's expulsion?

355
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:16,504
Horikita talked to the administration.

356
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:19,296
She told them that it wasn't right to expel someone

357
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:22,004
as they're struggling to learn. She said it's a process.

358
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,504
--Hey, wait a minute. --Horikita, is that true?

359
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:28,337
I've never seen her speak so passionately about anything.

360
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:30,671
It was quite impressive.

361
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:33,129
She presented this carefully constructed indictment,

362
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,921
and none of them could argue with her.

363
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,671
That's amazing, Horikita. You're a real hero.

364
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,671
Wow, I guess I had the wrong idea about you all along!

365
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,671
Can you believe it? All for you.

366
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,546
No, I can't. Why would she do that for my sake?

367
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:47,962
Look, I didn't.

368
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:50,546
I was doing it for my own benefit and nothing else.

369
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,629
Wow, beauty, passion, and brains!

370
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,046
I'll say!

371
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:02,087
Thanks for helping me out. I really appreciate it.

372
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,504
I should thank you!

373
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,046
You didn't have to let us have the party in your room.

374
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,546
No prob.

375
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,962
Hey, can I ask you something?

376
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:13,337
Yeah, what?

377
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:15,212
Well, would you say that girls

378
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,879
like Horikita are your type?

379
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,296
I'm just curious.

380
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,171
I always see you two together,

381
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:24,879
and all the girls in class are talking about it.

382
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:27,254
Horikita and I are just friends.

383
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:31,087
No, she's just my neighbor.

384
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,671
I see.

385
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,046
Okay, then.

386
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,587
I guess I should head back to my room.

387
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:38,462
Right.

388
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,087
Well, goodnight.

389
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,962
Goodnight to you, too.

390
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,796
Uh?

391
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,587
I thought the girls were on the higher floors.

392
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:07,046
Where could she be going this late at night?

393
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,671
I don't see why I should be hiding, but...

394
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:18,087
What a pain in the ass.

395
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,337
Uh?

396
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,004
So, you think you're better than me

397
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,712
just because you're prettier?

398
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,379
I hate your guts!

399
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:28,546
I swear to god, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

400
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,046
I wish you would just drop dead, Horikita!

401
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,671
I hate you! I hate you!

402
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,629
You stupid cow!

403
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,879
Who's there? Is someone spying on me?

404
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:45,796
It's just me.

405
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,629
Ayanokoji.

406
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,379
I'm sorry. You left your phone in my room.

407
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,171
Did you hear me?

408
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,712
If I told you that I didn't, would you believe me?

409
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:04,421
If you breathe a word about this to anyone, you'll pay.

410
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,504
How, exactly?

411
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:10,754
I'll tell everyone in the entire
school you attempted to rape me.

412
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:15,587
But you know that isn't true.

413
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,921
You're wrong.

414
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,087
I have the evidence to prove it.

415
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:24,171
Your fingerprints and DNA in a very telling location.

416
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:27,087
That's all the proof I need.

417
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,337
I'm deadly serious.

418
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:34,254
I understand. Can I please go back to my room?

419
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,504
You got it?

420
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,337
If you betray me, I'll make you pay.

421
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,129
Ayanokoji.

422
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:52,504
I want you to answer just one question.

423
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,254
Can you promise me right now that you won't tell anyone

424
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:57,337
what you heard me say?

425
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,462
I'm glad to hear it,

426
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:07,212
and I choose to believe you for the time being.

427
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:11,421
All right, then!

428
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,004
Well, I guess this means we have another secret!

429
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:18,921
Kushida. I don't understand.

430
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,879
Who are you, really?
