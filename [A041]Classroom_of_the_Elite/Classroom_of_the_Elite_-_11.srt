1
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,684
We need to segregate the girls' and boys' areas.

2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,726
We should move the boys' tent somewhere else,

3
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,142
and then make the girls' off-limit to the boys.

4
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:22,101
I don't know.

5
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,184
What would that solve?

6
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:24,351
If that's what you want,

7
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:25,934
then you guys should move it yourselves.

8
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:27,559
'Cause I'm sure as hell not gonna!

9
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:30,142
We weren't even asking for your help, jerk!

10
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:32,976
Hirata, you would help us move it, wouldn't you?

11
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,476
Yeah, of course.

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,017
I'll do it, but I think that
it's gonna take a little while.

13
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:43,559
I have no objections to separating

14
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,142
the boys from the girls.

15
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,976
But, while he's in the process of moving it,

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,226
Hirata would have access to both

17
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,434
the boys' and girls' areas, right?

18
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,017
Yeah, and what's your point?

19
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,017
I don't think he can be trusted to do it by himself.

20
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:56,892
Hirata isn't like that!

21
00:00:56,976 --> 00:00:58,642
Well, he is a boy, nevertheless.

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,642
We should add another guy to the tent detail.

23
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:05,017
That will double the manpower effectively,

24
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,059
and the other benefit is that the two boys

25
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,684
can keep an eye on each other.

26
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,434
But, that won't work.

27
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:14,184
There's no way we can trust
any of the boys besides Hirata.

28
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,059
There's someone else.

29
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,142
And it's him. Ayanokoji.

30
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,434
Well, that's wonderful. Trusted by default.

31
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,392
Look at it this way, it's a compliment from Horikita.

32
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,809
And Karuizawa thought it was a good idea, too.

33
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,059
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.

34
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:09,767
Your girlfriend said that I was pretty much invisible.

35
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,476
I didn't raise any red flags.

36
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,392
Hirata!

37
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,101
Sorry, could you come here for a minute?

38
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:19,726
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

39
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,601
I can handle the rest of this.

40
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,726
You go ahead.

41
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,934
Sorry. Thanks for your help.

42
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:35,559
The boys' tent is officially moved.

43
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,726
Can you talk for a sec?

44
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,226
Class D seems to be having trouble.

45
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,601
I guess we've all got our fair share of problems.

46
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,809
Regardless of the reason behind it, as a girl,

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,059
I can't abide underwear theft.

48
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:51,101
It's perverted. Unforgivable.

49
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,559
Who do you think was responsible for it?

50
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,392
You thought it was me, didn't you?

51
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,892
I'm an outsider, so naturally, you all suspect me.

52
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:01,976
Sudo's not the only one.

53
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,892
That's the truth. Just look at them.

54
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,892
They're over there, glaring at you.

55
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,892
Of course he is.

56
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,059
Why shouldn't they all be wary of me?

57
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:15,601
If I were in the same position,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

58
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:18,309
For what it's worth, I trust you.

59
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,059
Wow. Thank you.

60
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:27,226
That was honestly the last thing I expected you to say.

61
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,559
I was only telling you the truth.

62
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,517
Looks like I'll be dining by myself tonight.

63
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,767
How's it feel, getting forced into menial labor?

64
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,642
You've got some nerve.

65
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,809
If it weren't for you butting
in, it wouldn't have happened,

66
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,642
and I could have lived today in peace.

67
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:09,226
What was I supposed to do?

68
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,559
I couldn't trust Hirata by himself.

69
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,809
I needed you as insurance.

70
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:14,892
You know what?

71
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:17,142
Not everyone is hiding some evil side.

72
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:18,642
Some people are open books.

73
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:19,976
I guess that's true.

74
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:23,392
Take me for instance: I have nothing to hide.

75
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,642
But, still.

76
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,809
Most people'd do anything to keep the world

77
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,351
from knowing their innermost thoughts.

78
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,351
I know that's how you work.

79
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,142
And, because the virtuous are often

80
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:36,684
the most hypocritical,

81
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,309
I think I'm wise not to trust him.

82
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,642
Then why don't you just come clean, already?

83
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,392
I don't know what you're talking about.

84
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,726
Come on.

85
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,642
You haven't been feeling well since the test began.

86
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,642
You don't have to hide it from me.

87
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,434
I feel perfectly fine.

88
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:56,851
Hypocrite.

89
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:14,101
You better get your hand off me.

90
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:15,851
Just stop moving.

91
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:25,601
Almost 38 degrees Celsius. Huh.

92
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,601
What are you, a thermometer?

93
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,017
When we all met up on the ship before the test,

94
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,892
I asked where you'd been. Remember what you said?

95
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:42,976
Yeah, I told you that I'd been in my room, reading.

96
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,434
You weren't resting in your room because you felt sick?

97
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,226
This could hurt our score.

98
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,434
Do you plan to tell the others?

99
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:56,476
I've already held out for five days at this point.

100
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:00,267
If I tell them about it now, it'd be for nothing.

101
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:11,017
I thought it might rain overnight,

102
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:12,684
but those clouds look ominous.

103
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,892
I wish we had a boat or something.

104
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,809
A break from the sun is kinda nice, though.

105
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,267
There are some dark storm clouds

106
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,851
coming in fast from the southwest.

107
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,267
Weather's gonna get bad.

108
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,559
Get ready for things to take an ugly turn.

109
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,434
Huh.

110
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:27,392
What?

111
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,309
Oh. It's nothing.

112
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:30,851
We'd better hurry up and gather food

113
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,809
before it starts to pour. Right!

114
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,809
And I'm about to gather up a storm, uh, no pun intended.

115
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,684
Ike's become pretty reliable.

116
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:39,684
You'd better step it up

117
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,184
if you wanna prove your usefulness.

118
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,934
Yeah, same to you.

119
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:44,434
We've got a lot to gather.

120
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,434
If we're gonna secure a day's rations for everyone,

121
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:47,434
we've gotta work fast.

122
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,642
Duh.

123
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:51,392
So, why are we still standing around talking?

124
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,101
Let's see. Fruit, fruit, fruit.

125
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:01,726
Where's the fruit?

126
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,101
Is there something bothering you, Kushida?

127
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,642
I'm just thinking about Ayanokoji and Horikita.

128
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,559
They've always been close, haven't they?

129
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,267
I wonder what it is about the two of them

130
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,476
that lends itself to such intimacy.

131
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,726
That's true, now that you mention it.

132
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,601
Are you ready to do this?

133
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,517
Okay, let's spread it out.

134
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,601
Hey, Horikita.

135
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,976
What is it now?

136
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,517
This is important.

137
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,226
It's about the class's key card.

138
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,351
What are you doing to take care of it?

139
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,392
I keep it on me at all times.

140
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,184
Then, when it's time to renew the spot,

141
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,476
I do it with the other students surrounding me.

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,642
As was agreed upon.

143
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,809
As for Ibuki and the other classes,

144
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,517
there's no reason that they would be able to identify me.

145
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,726
Would you mind if I took a quick look at it?

146
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,392
Here? Seriously?

147
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,017
It would actually be best for us to do it here.

148
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:00,392
Taking it out at base camp is risky.

149
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,101
I guess, but still.

150
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,267
Why do you want to?

151
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:04,476
What's the point of it?

152
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,892
Here's the truth:

153
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,809
on the first day of the test, I saw a student holding

154
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,351
what I thought looked like a key card.

155
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:11,017
A Class A guy.

156
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,309
The thing is,

157
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,892
I have no way of knowing if it was, in fact,

158
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,434
a real key card or not.

159
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:20,101
'Cause I've never actually
seen one of them up close before.

160
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,517
That's true.

161
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,684
What you saw wouldn't be positive proof

162
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,851
if you didn't have a reliable point of reference.

163
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:34,017
Well, then?

164
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:37,101
Dunno. I still can't say.

165
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,142
I thought I'd know for certain after I saw it myself,

166
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,351
but the color might be different.

167
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:43,226
I'm not sure.

168
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,434
It's also possible that the school gave

169
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,642
each of the classes different color cards.

170
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:48,851
Yeah.

171
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,351
Hey, check this out!

172
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,851
Having a little private chat?

173
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,934
You're a bit too close!

174
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,392
Why you gotta leave the rest of us out of it?

175
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,101
Welp, I guess now I have to call you Muddykita!

176
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,184
Hey! Why would you do something like that?

177
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,684
C'mon.

178
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,809
Now her boyfriend's supposed to defend her honor. Y'know?

179
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,642
Right, Ayanokoji?

180
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,559
Ow. Hey, what--?

181
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,184
That hurt!

182
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,684
Oh, Horikita. You're covered in mud!

183
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,059
We should get you cleaned off right away!

184
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:35,601
Yeah, you're right, I can't stay like this, can I?

185
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,059
Horikita.

186
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:40,976
Were you trying to kill him?

187
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,642
If I hadn't reacted, you could have split

188
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,851
Yamauchi's head wide open.

189
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,976
Only two fish?

190
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:28,559
I can't believe you survived that!

191
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,392
Man, she's terrifying.

192
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,976
Maybe we should take a dip in the river,

193
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,267
since we're such a mess from working.

194
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,726
We won't be able to use the shower for a million years.

195
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,309
Yeah, the girls from the foraging team

196
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,476
have called dibs on it for a while, huh?

197
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,642
Who knows when they'll be done.

198
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,559
Dang, look at that line, man!

199
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,642
Huh.

200
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,601
Horikita?

201
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:04,726
Um, Ayanokoji.

202
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,684
Uh. Do you think you could come take a walk

203
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,642
with me for a minute?

204
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,642
We can't talk freely here.

205
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,517
What is this about?

206
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,309
You wanted me to go into the forest with you

207
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,517
and search for more food, or something?

208
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:38,142
Horikita?

209
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:45,351
Listen. I was careless.

210
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,267
I tell you this with full knowledge of my mistake.

211
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,642
Is that clear?

212
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,976
Mistake?

213
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,976
Something was taken.

214
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,267
Wait a minute.

215
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:56,851
You're not telling me that your underwear

216
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,601
was stolen, too, are you?

217
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:01,517
No, it's much worse than that.

218
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,726
What I'm telling you is...

219
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:09,434
The class key card was stolen.

220
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,601
I don't think we should tell anyone.

221
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:16,559
For right now, let's keep it to ourselves.

222
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,809
Just until we know the extent of things.

223
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:19,642
Yes.

224
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,851
If everyone else found out,

225
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,642
it would throw them into a panic.

226
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,934
And that's the last thing we need to happen now.

227
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,684
I have two suspects in mind already.

228
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,059
It's either Karuizawa, or Ibuki, which is more likely.

229
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,059
Are things really that bad

230
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,976
between you and Karuizawa?

231
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,476
In ways someone like you would never see.

232
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,351
Ways that were inevitable.

233
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,392
If you say so, but I seriously doubt it was her.

234
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:42,767
She's been in line for the shower

235
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,767
since before you went to clean up.

236
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,351
You're sure about that?

237
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,976
Yeah. Saw her with my own eyes.

238
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,726
Well, then. Ibuki's the culprit.

239
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,476
We should find the right time, and then ask her flat out.

240
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,017
Worst case scenario would be

241
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,351
if she took it and ran off with it.

242
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,184
That's true.

243
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,851
I'm so sorry.

244
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,434
I think it's best if you head back first.

245
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,601
I can catch up with you a little later.

246
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:10,976
Sure.

247
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:18,726
It's an unbelievable failure.

248
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,767
I bet she's so miserable she wants to crawl off somewhere.

249
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,101
Huh.

250
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,226
Hurry, someone bring us some water, quickly!

251
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,142
--Good idea! --Damn!

252
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,726
She looks shocked.

253
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,726
Does this mean she didn't do it, after all?

254
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,976
Someone set the manual on fire?

255
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,226
Who would do something like this?

256
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,809
I found a fire extinguisher!

257
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:23,517
Step back. I'll put it out!

258
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:30,392
If it's not one thing, then it's another.

259
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,642
Why does this keep happening around here?

260
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,184
Does it mean we have a traitor in class

261
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,601
who's turned against us?

262
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,559
Why do you keep assuming it's one of us?

263
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,642
This is nothing like the stupid panty theft thing.

264
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,892
We don't know that!

265
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,059
Maybe you set it on fire to distract us from it!

266
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,267
Don't be stupid!

267
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:45,892
We'd never do something like that!

268
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,142
We're not dumb enough to start a fire in the forest!

269
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,517
--Everyone, just calm down. -- Why would we ever

270
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,726
believe the lies out of the mouth

271
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,976
of some nasty, underwear-stealing pervert?

272
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,684
None of us stole your underwear!

273
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,059
Obviously, the perverts stick up for each other.

274
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:58,142
What's wrong with you?

275
00:15:58,226 --> 00:15:59,809
You keep calling us perverts,

276
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,351
but maybe you're projecting!

277
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,101
Looks like it's about to start pouring.

278
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:09,392
I hate this. You people are the worst!

279
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,976
I can't believe I have to be in class

280
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,226
with a panty thief and an arsonist!

281
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,684
What, are you deaf or something?

282
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,976
No one in this class took that stupid underwear!

283
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,934
Hey, has anyone seen Ibuki lately?

284
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,642
What? She isn't here, either?

285
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,892
Huh? She was just here a minute ago, I swear.

286
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,934
That sure seems suspicious, right?

287
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:31,142
Yeah, it's definitely suspicious.

288
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:33,017
Are you saying that she started the fire?

289
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:35,059
Do you think that means this whole time she was...

290
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,976
I knew she was a spy this entire time!

291
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,642
And now she ran away? Damn that girl!

292
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:42,809
Not good.

293
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,767
Anyway, we can deal with that later.

294
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,517
Now, Hirata, what should we do?

295
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,392
Uh... Hirata?

296
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,559
How could... this happen?

297
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,267
I've done nothing to deserve this.

298
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:58,226
How could someone...

299
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,601
Who would be so vindictive?

300
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,726
This is just malicious.

301
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:08,101
Hirata. Ike asked you a question.

302
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,684
Raining.

303
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,059
You should help the others out.

304
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:17,767
The clothes are still hanging on the clothes line.

305
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:18,851
Yeah, you're right.

306
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,934
We need to go put them away.

307
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,726
And we'd better get out of the rain, too.

308
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,101
Girls, start bringing all the clothes in from the line.

309
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:26,976
Boys, you go cover up the firewood.

310
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,559
It's useless if it's soaked through.

311
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,059
Come on. Let's hurry!

312
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,101
Right!

313
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,184
That just leaves...

314
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,726
She couldn't have gotten very far.

315
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,476
Took you long enough.

316
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:48,601
The underwear theft and the arson-induced panic.

317
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,559
It's odd how much trouble Class D has now.

318
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,892
What of it?

319
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:55,517
Don't play dumb with me. You're a hostile outsider.

320
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,351
You know we suspect you.

321
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,351
Do you have the proof to back that up?

322
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,351
Unfortunately, I don't have any solid evidence.

323
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,309
I can't tie you to the underwear theft.

324
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:06,434
But I'm not dumb.

325
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,309
We both know that you're the culprit.

326
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,392
That's not a very nice thing to say.

327
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:13,267
Why don't we settle this the easy way, right now.

328
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,809
Give me back what you took from me.

329
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,434
I don't know what you mean.

330
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:24,559
My limbs feel so heavy, and I'm hot.

331
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:27,809
No, am I cold?

332
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:30,517
Things aren't looking very good for me.

333
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,184
But I don't care.

334
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:35,434
I'm gonna tell you one more time.

335
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,184
Give it back to me right now.

336
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,434
Take whatever you want.

337
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,142
Hey. You're fast.

338
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:54,684
You could get disqualified for doing that.

339
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,059
Disqualified by whom?

340
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:59,142
No one's here to see it. Anyway.

341
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:01,726
I think you came looking for a fight!

342
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,226
Nice. You've done this before, haven't you?

343
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,476
If I can't get it back, I'll let Class D down

344
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,309
in the worst possible way.

345
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,767
I looked down my nose at all of them.

346
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,351
Called them worthless and stupid.

347
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,809
When, all along, at the end of the day, I'm useless.

348
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:27,976
A failure, resorting to violence. It's pathetic.

349
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,684
Just admit it was you.

350
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,851
You're the one who stole the key card.

351
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:48,601
Since you've worked so hard, I guess I'll tell you.

352
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:52,184
Yes. I'm the one who stole your precious card.

353
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,642
I expected to have to work a
lot harder to get it out of you.

354
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,059
You can't say I used violence.

355
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:04,476
There's no proof. That's too bad.

356
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,351
If I got that card,

357
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,892
I could analyze your fingerprints.

358
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:13,017
And then I could prove that you stole the underwear, too.

359
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,934
If I can just get her off balance.

360
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,934
I've been convinced of this for a while.

361
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:34,809
I thought for sure you were involved in it somehow.

362
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,767
The fire at the camp earlier.

363
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,684
Why do you think I would be so evasive

364
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,184
when talking to you?

365
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,976
I just wanted to confirm my suspicions about you first.

366
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,184
Do you mean...?

367
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,601
I've gotta go.

368
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:03,059
I have another appointment now, you see.

369
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:06,351
This was a nice talk. But it's over.

370
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,184
Oh, the item that you requested?

371
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:25,684
I got it for you.
