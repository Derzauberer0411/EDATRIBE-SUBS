1
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:38,718
The semester was over at last.

2
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:42,134
We'd finished finals and started summer vacation.

3
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:00,301
Huh...?

4
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,593
Can't you take a hint? I don't want to talk to you.

5
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,759
Horikita.

6
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,301
What now?

7
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,759
Listen, do you want to go swimming with me?

8
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,301
This is the worst.

9
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,634
Where the hell is he?

10
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:08,884
My apologies for being late.

11
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,718
I thought I said to make sure you got here on time, dude!

12
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,926
Whatever.

13
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,718
Did you at least bring everything we need?

14
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,426
Yeah, of course I did.

15
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,676
Better make sure you set it up right.

16
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,593
Time to implement Operation:

17
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:24,468
Peep on the Girl's Dressing Room.

18
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,593
This ought to help alleviate our frustration a little bit.

19
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,384
I've got a bad feeling.

20
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,634
Oh? Hey, look! It's Horikita!

21
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,593
Man, it's been forever. What's up?

22
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:53,384
Wow, Suzune, there were rumors you had died or something.

23
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,009
No one in school had seen a trace of you

24
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,551
since summer break started.

25
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,843
I had no real reason to see any of you people.

26
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,384
Kei Karuizawa.

27
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:04,134
Kushida leads one of the two cliques in Class D.

28
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,676
Kei leads the other.

29
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,718
Dating Hirata has increased her influence

30
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:11,801
over our class exponentially, and it's easy to see why.

31
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,884
And as far as Yosuke Hirata goes...

32
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,384
He's a central figure among the Class D boys.

33
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,676
He's an above-average athlete,

34
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,468
and his grades are decent enough.

35
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,176
He's gregarious, too.

36
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,926
I haven't yet figured out how he ended up

37
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,801
in the loser class in the first place.

38
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,676
Look, Horikita.

39
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,884
Why don't you hang out with the D Class peeps sometime.

40
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,468
It wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.

41
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,843
I'll pass, thanks.

42
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,051
I have no need to, "give it a shot," as you say.

43
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,301
My time would be better spent studying or reading.

44
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,468
Well, that's just fine with us, then.

45
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,968
Let's get going, Hirata.

46
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,384
She doesn't think we're worth her time,

47
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,343
so why should we bother with her?

48
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:47,676
'Kay, let's go. Later, Horikita.

49
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,259
I don't need friends.

50
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,759
I've made it this far without them,

51
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,009
why should I change my tack now?

52
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,426
So, then...

53
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,134
What the heck am I even doing here with these idiots?

54
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:03,343
I'm so excited that you decided to come, too, Horikita!

55
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,968
Kikyo Kushida.

56
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,509
She's the picture of benevolence.

57
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:09,259
Liked equally by both girls and guys alike.

58
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,551
And yet, I suspect that she hates me.

59
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,509
I have a strange feeling about her.

60
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:16,176
Honestly, I hope that this trip is what finally leads us

61
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,218
to friendship! Yay!

62
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,718
She's an enigma.

63
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:23,093
Who doggedly pursues friendships
with the people they hate?

64
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,134
I don't get it.

65
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,384
What's the matter?

66
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,218
Are we still waiting on Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudo?

67
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,676
I thought they were coming with us.

68
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,259
Yeah, me, too. I don't know.

69
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,343
Hey, you guys. Sorry we're late!

70
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,259
We all just overslept. Can you believe it?

71
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:38,718
You overslept?

72
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,093
But you three're coming from the direction of the pool.

73
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,551
Uh, yeah.

74
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,551
It's super not important or anything, okay?

75
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:49,634
Right, don't worry about that.
Hadn't we better get going now?

76
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:52,384
Yeah, time's wasting. Let's go!

77
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,426
Oh, my gosh!

78
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,176
Hey, you guys!

79
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,593
Are you all headed to the pool, too?

80
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,426
Today's the last day the pool's open,

81
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,801
so we'd better make the most of it.

82
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,051
Yeah. Some other people might be coming, too.

83
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,509
How long has your chest been that big?

84
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,884
What?! That's awkward.

85
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,343
I guess it started in the third year of middle school.

86
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,968
Then, they just kept getting bigger.

87
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:38,468
Why do you ask?

88
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,718
Oh, no particular reason.

89
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,301
But I see why you always seem to have

90
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,009
more on your plate than you can handle.

91
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,593
Hey, I just realized!

92
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:48,259
This is the first time you've
hung out with all of us, Sakura!

93
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:49,468
Exciting!

94
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,093
Do you like to go swimming?

95
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,301
Um. No.

96
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,093
I'm not really a fan of it.

97
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:56,968
I'm only here because Ayanokoji invited me.

98
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,384
Oh, I see now!

99
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,718
You came along because you have a crush on him, then!

100
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,134
No. I-It's not like that.

101
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:04,718
It's interesting.

102
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,926
I've noticed a lot more people
hanging around Ayanokoji lately.

103
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,384
He and Ichinose seem to have gotten really close.

104
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:11,634
Have you noticed?

105
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,093
I have.

106
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,301
Honami Ichinose.

107
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,634
The central female figure in Class B.

108
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:19,093
She came through for Class D

109
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,426
during an incident in the first term.

110
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,634
But I find her hard to read.

111
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:25,884
What do you think, Horikita?

112
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,884
I bet that makes you nervous, huh.

113
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,759
Ayanokoji's social habits make no difference to me.

114
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,759
I have no feelings whatsoever on the matter.

115
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,468
Uh? Oh, really?

116
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,343
Operation Young Lust: Phase Two.

117
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:57,884
This is HQ, operatives. Let's get this party started.

118
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,926
Time limit is the end of the day.

119
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,551
We've got until the targets go home.

120
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,551
Argos-One here. Roger that.

121
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,718
--Ah! You got me! --Take that!

122
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:17,301
All right, it's time to have some fun!

123
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,884
Sakura, are you wearing a wet
suit so you don't get sunburned?

124
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,926
No, I just don't like showing too much skin

125
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,009
in front of other people.

126
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,634
Ow!

127
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,968
I got a brand new swimsuit, you like?

128
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,718
Oh yeah, we like!

129
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,634
Uh? Hey, guys. Where did Yamauchi go?

130
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,718
How did we lose him so soon?

131
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:39,884
Maybe we should go look for him.

132
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,218
It's okay, there's no need! Don't worry!

133
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,426
I bet he's in the bathroom. Let's focus on having fun!

134
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,676
Oh! Look, there's a volleyball court over there!

135
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,801
Let's go play! We should go play right now!

136
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:52,093
Fine. But, like, why are you freaking out about it?

137
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,259
Listen.

138
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:10,884
I'm not very good at sports, so maybe I shouldn't play.

139
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,301
No, you should play!

140
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,343
We have some strong boys on our team, so don't worry!

141
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,176
Okay, here we go!

142
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,218
Take that!

143
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,176
I hope it's not too crowded.

144
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,509
I left my sunscreen. Can I use yours?

145
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:27,634
Hey, what's this about?

146
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,884
Where are we supposed to change?

147
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,051
Damn it! The camera won't cooperate with me at all.

148
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,009
What am I supposed to do now?

149
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:41,551
Uh? What's going on over there?

150
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:42,759
It's the line for the bathroom.

151
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,426
You think something bad happened?

152
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:45,759
I guess we should go check it out.

153
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,218
No! Stay right here!

154
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,634
Who even cares about the stupid line for the bathrooms

155
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,968
when we've got a game to win?!

156
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,634
Huh. What's wrong with Ike?

157
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:56,718
I don't know.

158
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,259
Maybe he's just always been this weird.

159
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,676
HQ here, come in.

160
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,676
Argos-two.

161
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,301
Awaiting your report.

162
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:10,801
You there, Argos-two? What's happening?

163
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,509
I'm having major trouble.

164
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,926
A failure like me just isn't
cut out for this kind of work.

165
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,051
I don't think I can do it.

166
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,551
You must keep the faith.

167
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,259
Faith in yourself, and in your allies

168
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:28,051
who have placed their faith in you.

169
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,968
Don't stop believing in the cause.

170
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:32,301
Boo-yah!

171
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:34,968
I can't!

172
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,634
Hey, Yamauchi's been gone a really long time.

173
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,176
I think we should go out looking
for him now, don't you agree?

174
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,593
Uh. No way!

175
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,801
Don't worry, Kushida. I'm sure he just got distracted!

176
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,759
But something bad could've happened to him.

177
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,718
Aren't you at least a little bit concerned?

178
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,718
No, no! I'm sure he's just fine!

179
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,051
But, Ike. He's your friend, isn't he?

180
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,718
Shouldn't you be worried about him?

181
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:55,134
Uh. Wait.

182
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:57,301
She'll think I'm shallow if I keep hiding things!

183
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,468
If manga's taught me anything,

184
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:00,176
it's that chicks love male friendships.

185
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,843
I can't! If I'm not concerned, she might hate me!

186
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:06,968
No, no, no, I can't give up the cause just for her sake!

187
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,426
HQ here, checking in.

188
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,468
Argos-two. You're out of time.

189
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,259
You must abandon the mission.

190
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,384
Return to the base at once.

191
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:35,634
Forgive me.

192
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:37,343
I am incompetent.

193
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,759
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:41,634
Apologizing is not going to fix anything now!

195
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,801
I'm sorry. But I didn't want Kushida

196
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,551
to hate me over this!

197
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,301
Seriously, guys, let's go look for him!

198
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,301
Let's all play some volleyball!

199
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:50,676
Yamauchi's back!

200
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,718
Wow, the line for the bathroom was insane!

201
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,051
It was?

202
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:57,259
Still, I'm relieved you're back. I was so worried.

203
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,926
So, um, now that Yamauchi's back in the game,

204
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,301
do you think it would be okay--

205
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:03,926
Ah! My stomach's killing me!

206
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,259
I've gotta go to the bathroom right now!

207
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,634
...rotate out.

208
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,301
Huh? Get this out of my way.

209
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:18,968
Sure thing, boss.

210
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,468
Let's go.

211
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:24,884
HQ reporting!

212
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,843
Enemy-R is approaching quickly!

213
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,009
Ah... But I'm just about done with Phase Two.

214
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:30,384
I can finish it!

215
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:32,884
You don't have time! Argos-one, you have to withdraw!

216
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,176
Withdraw, now!

217
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,301
Argos-one! Retreat!

218
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,426
My leg is cramping! I've gotta go!

219
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,301
That must be an intense muscle cramp.

220
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:12,384
You're down to five.

221
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:13,634
Do you want to continue playing,

222
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,426
or should we call it quits for now?

223
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,468
Uh...

224
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,051
Listen.

225
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,051
I think we should call it and
forfeit this one to you guys.

226
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,093
That way we can go take care of Ike and Sudo.

227
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,384
Don't ever give up on your dreams!

228
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,968
I'll play hard enough for both of them combined.

229
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,593
So, you better not even think of quitting!

230
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,759
Or are you saying that our beach volleyball memories

231
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,759
never meant anything to you at all?!

232
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:36,718
Come on, everybody, show me all the passion and grit

233
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,718
you can muster to win this thing!

234
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,301
Huh...?

235
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,593
Has Yamauchi always been this passionate about sports?

236
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:45,218
I never knew that he had a distinct personality.

237
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,843
To be honest, I've always had considerable difficulty

238
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:50,468
telling him and Ike apart from each other.

239
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,968
Huh? There's no one cleaning these bathrooms.

240
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,218
Setup complete.

241
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,801
Now I've just gotta get out of here!

242
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,968
It's too soon to let your guard down just yet,

243
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,759
Argos-one. There are two women there with Enemy-R!

244
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,009
Do you read?

245
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,884
I repeat, two women with the approaching enemy!

246
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,093
Ouch, that hurt.

247
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:13,093
Oops. I couldn't stop it.

248
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,509
It's okay. Don't worry!

249
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:15,384
It's cool!

250
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,259
This isn't cool!

251
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,301
You can't just come barging in here!

252
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,593
The sign clearly says this place is off-limits!

253
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,259
Then what are you doing here?

254
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,218
You seriously think I care?

255
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,259
I go where I want.

256
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,468
Uh...

257
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,468
What an unsightly scene.

258
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:35,218
A fight between two bottom-feeders is just pathetic.

259
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,051
Sakayanagi?

260
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,551
You weren't invited.

261
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:41,134
Take your mangy dogs and get out of here.

262
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,384
No thanks.

263
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:44,968
Perhaps I should domesticate you, too.

264
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,259
What's all this fuss about here?

265
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:49,884
--Mm? --Huh?

266
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:54,718
I am aware that this place

267
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,968
is a recreational facility.

268
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,551
But, that doesn't mean school rules don't apply.

269
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,051
Don't forget you're all still on campus.

270
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:06,051
So the Student Council President decided to show up.

271
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:11,301
I can tell you're holding back.

272
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,718
No, I'm just not very good at sports.

273
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,926
You're athletic.

274
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,384
I've seen you show your skill, remember?

275
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,009
Why do you hide what you're capable of?

276
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,676
Why, does it irritate you?

277
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,593
Or is it that you just don't want to lose at anything?

278
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,009
Not in the least.

279
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,343
I admire that.

280
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,759
What's the point in playing a game

281
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:35,384
if you're not committed to winning it at all costs?

282
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,593
Being vulnerable and letting your emotions show

283
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:39,718
would help you make friends, too.

284
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,218
I've told you, I don't need any friends.

285
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,593
Hey, what's happening in the locker rooms?

286
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,343
HQ checking in.

287
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,468
Argos-one. What's your status?

288
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,634
I'm ready to withdraw, but I can't.

289
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,051
Help me. With all of the obstacles outside,

290
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,176
I'm stuck in here!

291
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,676
It's all over. We made it so far.

292
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,843
You can't give up now, when we're so close!

293
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:07,676
Hey, look. I have to ask you.

294
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,759
Do you think that this whole thing was a mistake?

295
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:14,176
How can you say that?

296
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,801
Listen. If I don't end up making
it out of this place alive...

297
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:22,093
You must not abandon hope, soldier!

298
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,801
Sotomura.

299
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,051
You're to refer to me as HQ, Argos-one.

300
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,468
And that's an order.

301
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:30,426
Even as you suffer in there for the cause,

302
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,801
you've got comrades out here waiting for you,

303
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:34,468
depending on you.

304
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,468
So, do not abandon hope.

305
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:38,759
Heh.

306
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:43,468
Argos-one? Argos-one!

307
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:44,843
I'm sorry, bud.

308
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:46,843
Almost lost my nerve.

309
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:48,801
Argos-one!

310
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:52,259
HQ, you'd better contact Argos-four.

311
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:55,009
Tell him it's a go. Execute Phase Extra.

312
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:03,009
"Draw attention away from the locker rooms?

313
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:08,509
Student council president, Ryuen, and others, too?"

314
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:12,968
This is getting ridiculous.

315
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:14,759
Horikita.

316
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,468
I need you to help me with something important.

317
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,051
Look, I have a terrible leg cramp!

318
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,551
Stay away from me!

319
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,051
It doesn't look that way to me.

320
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,801
Something's going down over there!

321
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:28,718
Isn't that Horikita from Class One-D?

322
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,259
Horikita?

323
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:34,051
Give me the names of who did this, and Al will go easy.

324
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,759
The girl's name is Horikita.

325
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,301
What do you think's come over Horikita?

326
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,801
I'm just as confused as you.

327
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:57,509
Why do I even have to get involved in this?

328
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:04,009
Allow me to begin by saying

329
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,218
we are Class-D, year one!

330
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,301
We've been labeled the defective students at this school.

331
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:11,176
We're the problem children.

332
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,884
We're fools, and we fall for the schemes

333
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,884
of other classes pretty easily.

334
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,218
So, to the students of Class C,

335
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:20,968
you made a bold move in trying
to sabotage our class before.

336
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,176
But now...

337
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,509
...I am grateful for all of your efforts.

338
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:26,634
Thanks to you, everything is clearer.

339
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,968
A class full of defectives will have a rough time

340
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:30,509
if we aim high.

341
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:34,134
But now I see that all classes,
A to D, aren't separated by

342
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,509
anything as simple as pure academic prowess

343
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:38,009
or athletic ability.

344
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:39,301
That's good news.

345
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,259
Especially for loser Class D.

346
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,218
It means we could become Class A.

347
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:45,718
We can beat you all and ascend to the top.

348
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:49,093
I promise you this: We will make it to Class A!

349
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,176
Uh?

350
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,801
We love you, Horikita!

351
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,759
You're incredible!

352
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,468
You rock!

353
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,718
Oh, really, Class D?

354
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,009
You better watch it!

355
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:18,718
Tidal wave, comin' atcha!

356
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:19,718
Ow, ow, ow.

357
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:20,843
What a bunch of perverts.

358
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,968
Hm?

359
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,384
There really were cameras set up

360
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,593
in the dressing room, like you said.

361
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,051
Seriously.

362
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,718
Do you wanna go to the pool with me?

363
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,301
Absolutely not.

364
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,384
Look, to be frank, I need a huge favor from you.

365
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,801
Class D's future is on the line.

366
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:49,384
How so?

367
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,343
Ike's the one who suggested we go to the pool.

368
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:54,134
He's planning to set up cameras
in the women's dressing room.

369
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:57,218
 So he and the guys can spy on you all changing.

370
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:58,468
Uh?

371
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:01,676
If I had tried to stop them,

372
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,843
they probably would have gone behind my back.

373
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:06,134
Found a way to go forward with it.

374
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,468
It was better to let them do it and foil them secretly.

375
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,843
I hate to admit it, but you were right.

376
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,676
Their plan was to set up the cameras,

377
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,176
then retrieve them later tonight
after everyone had gone home.

378
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,634
But that's not gonna happen now.

379
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,843
We beat them to the chase.

380
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,343
We could have stopped them earlier.

381
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:24,259
If we'd removed the cards in advance.

382
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,093
Then they would have gotten nothing.

383
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:29,051
Yeah, that was the initial plan, actually.

384
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:31,259
But the interference from other classes made things

385
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,259
a lot more difficult.

386
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,426
Is that why you made me give that stupid speech?

387
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,093
To divert people's attention away from them?

388
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:41,176
But you got such thunderous applause.

389
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,301
Sudo and the others were moved to tears by your words.

390
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:47,843
More importantly, did you have fun at the pool today?

391
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,509
You spent your whole summer alone.

392
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,051
So, was getting out refreshing?

393
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,676
I didn't come to this school to have fun.

394
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,093
Besides, people bore me.

395
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:56,884
I have much more fun by myself.

396
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,218
Sure you do.

397
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,759
Well, we've got some time before the pool closes.

398
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:08,759
What is your problem?

399
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:10,634
Sorry, I had to do it.

400
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,759
Uh!

401
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:20,218
That's payback.

402
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,259
Hey! I wanna join in the fun!

403
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:24,551
Kushida, stop!

404
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,051
We're not playing!

405
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,509
Take that! And that!

406
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,551
Hey, Horikita, check it out!

407
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:32,426
Wa-hoo!

408
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,176
You idiots stop splashing my face!

409
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,801
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

410
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,801
Uh? What's this?

411
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:23,093
It's less of a risk to be by myself.
