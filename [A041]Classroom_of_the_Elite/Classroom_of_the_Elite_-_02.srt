1
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,554
Ah! Hey, stop splashing me!

2
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:23,679
Couldn't help myself.

3
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,595
It doesn't hurt to have some fun!

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,054
Fine. Bring it on!

5
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,845
Ah, free time during swim class.

6
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,970
People have naturally broken up into groups,

7
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,804
which makes sense, I guess.

8
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:37,470
It's official.

9
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,845
I have utterly failed at making friends.

10
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,429
I'm destined to be a loner.

11
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,929
What are you brooding about over here?

12
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:53,304
Oh, I was just embroiled in a painful internal struggle.

13
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,637
How can these losers even enjoy themselves?

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,054
You'd think that they would be more deflated.

15
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,512
Maybe that's how these guys cope.

16
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,387
They wanna have some fun, while they still can.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,095
You could be right, I guess.

18
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:07,095
Hey, stop it!

19
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,845
They sure are having a good time.

20
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,512
It's early in the spring for swimming to start,

21
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,095
and they're first years on a free class period.

22
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:49,679
It's normal for them to enjoy themselves, don't you think?

23
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:52,054
They're like a bunch of grade school kids.

24
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:55,887
Although, I suppose I can't really fault them for it.

25
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,679
But in the S-system,

26
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,804
they're going to suffer for that attitude.

27
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,012
But aren't you and I just like them?

28
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,512
Maybe.

29
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,387
The S-system...

30
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:12,429
Indeed, this is called the S-system.

31
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,929
It evaluates students in real time,

32
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:17,054
and assigns numerical value.

33
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,804
Observe. Class D has thoroughly proven

34
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,470
that you deserve to be ranked dead last.

35
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:25,845
You truly are the worst of the worst.

36
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:28,304
Zero?

37
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:36,012
However, I am rather impressed with this class.

38
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:39,012
Never in the history of this
school has a class blown through

39
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,679
all of their points in the first month, not even Class D.

40
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,762
Excuse me, will you at least tell us what

41
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:47,470
the school's criteria is for gaining and losing points?

42
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:51,304
You're preparing for the real world, so figure it out.

43
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:53,679
In the workforce, you're expected to come to the table

44
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:55,929
knowing what to do.

45
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,720
On the board, I have written

46
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,595
the current scores held by all first-year classes.

47
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,929
For every point the class gets, 100 private points

48
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,595
are distributed to each student individually.

49
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,595
When the school year began, each first-year class

50
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,179
was allotted 1,000 collective points.

51
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:16,137
To be frank, you people lost every point you had.

52
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,804
Teacher. Will we get the chance to earn any points back?

53
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,179
Of course.

54
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,345
And in doing so, if you earn more points than Class C

55
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,595
you'll be promoted up to Class C,

56
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,262
and Class C will be downgraded to D.

57
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:33,470
Your earliest opportunity to do this

58
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:36,470
is coming up in the midterms. Depending on your scores,

59
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:39,262
you can earn as many as 100 points for the class.

60
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,012
A hundred measly points?

61
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,554
Yeah, but it's better than nothing, right?

62
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:45,345
However...

63
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:48,512
...these are the grades from
the most recent quiz you took.

64
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:53,137
And, as you can see, they are complete garbage.

65
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,887
From this point forward,

66
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,054
anyone who receives a failing grade

67
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:02,054
on any midterms or finals will be expelled immediately.

68
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,345
Considering this most recent
development, everyone in class

69
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,804
is gonna have to completely change their habits.

70
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,179
And that's only to get us a few meager points.

71
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,012
So, if everyone doesn't ace the midterms,

72
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:21,720
we're all going to be royally screwed.

73
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,054
That's right.

74
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,845
Even more than that, if we're going to measure up

75
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,304
and achieve the high college entry and employment rates

76
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,512
they promised us, we're going to have to push ourselves

77
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:33,095
from here on out to overtake Class C.

78
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,387
Beating Class C has to be the primary goal now.

79
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,054
'Cause if we can't even do
that, we have no hope of advancing.

80
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,345
Were you just doing an impression of Chabashira?

81
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,720
No, why?

82
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:50,595
Sounded like her. A little.

83
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,179
I was wondering.

84
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:55,470
Do you play sports or something?

85
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,970
No, not at all.

86
00:05:57,054 --> 00:06:00,637
In fact, in middle school, I did nothing extracurricular.

87
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,387
That makes no sense.

88
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,095
Your forearms are so muscular, I thought you must.

89
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,554
Hey, there, Horikita!

90
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,012
Do you maybe wanna come swim with us?

91
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,554
Would you please go away?

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,845
You don't have to be mean.

93
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,262
Are you a bad swimmer or something?

94
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,637
No, I am an incredibly average swimmer.

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,095
Back in middle school, I was probably the worst swimmer

96
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,012
in the whole wide world! But then I practiced really hard,

97
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,262
and nowadays I don't think I'm that bad at all!

98
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,970
Wow. That's fascinating.

99
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,387
She's totally aloof, isn't she?

100
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,054
I do wish I could find a way to get along with her better.

101
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,637
Hey, guys.

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,429
Do you have a minute to talk about something?

103
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,012
We didn't get any points again today,

104
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,679
and that has got to change.

105
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,220
I don't want this problem to haunt us

106
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,095
for the rest of our time at this school.

107
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,387
We have to do something to turn this around.

108
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,595
There's no way I want to go all the way to graduation

109
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,179
without earning any more points.

110
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:56,512
I agree, we can't let that happen!

111
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:59,345
You're right, and we won't. We'll turn this around.

112
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:01,137
Next month, we're going to get more points

113
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,595
than any other class.

114
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,845
I don't know why you keep saying, "we," like that.

115
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,970
Seriously. You can leave me out of it!

116
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,262
Class D again.

117
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,554
You're both in Class A.

118
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:28,012
Sakayanagi... and Katsuragi.

119
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,387
Congratulations are in order.

120
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,095
Your class earned a total of 940 points this month.

121
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,429
Quite a feat.

122
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:38,220
I do hope you're both very proud of yourselves.

123
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,012
Now, then.

124
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,387
How much do you know about the S-system?

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,470
Hey, Doc! You're my best friend.

126
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,970
You gotta help me out!

127
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,845
Buy this console from me for 20,000 points?

128
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,512
Actually, it's so funny.

129
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,470
I spent all my points on accessories

130
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:58,304
so I'm totally broke now. I was thinking about borrowing

131
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,304
a couple of points from all the girls in class

132
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:01,637
to buy the essentials.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,262
You're one of my best friends, aren't you?

134
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,970
Do you have any plans for lunch?

135
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,304
I was wondering if you would be able to join me.

136
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,137
Well, let's eat, then.

137
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,762
Thank you for the food.

138
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,012
I have to ask... Are you sure it's okay

139
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:21,012
that I put this super expensive lunch on your tab?

140
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:22,554
I feel awkward.

141
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,012
Yes. I told you to get whatever
you wanted, and I meant it.

142
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:29,554
Lunch today is my treat. So don't feel awkward.

143
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:30,887
What now?

144
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,304
Is something wrong with you, Ayanokoji?

145
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,012
Dig in, already.

146
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:36,470
Right.

147
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,055
Now, listen, I want you to hear
me out on something important.

148
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:42,595
I'm aware that Hirata and the others

149
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,720
worked out a plan of action earlier today.

150
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:47,720
They're all forming a study group.

151
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:50,179
Their goal is to make sure they ace the test.

152
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:51,720
A study group?

153
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,637
Yes. But three of our classmates refused to join,

154
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,929
and it just so happens they're
the ones with the lowest scores.

155
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,179
Sudo, right?

156
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,845
Yes, and Yamauchi and Ike, as well.

157
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,512
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

158
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,304
Those three never did strike me as the studious type.

159
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,595
I don't see how anyone could fail a test.

160
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,720
Nevertheless, the fact remains--they did.

161
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,970
There are kids out there who don't even know what it means

162
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,262
to be a good student.

163
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,679
I guess some people really are that pathetic.

164
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,304
That's cold. Don't you have any sympathy?

165
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:23,429
Would being sympathetic keep it from being true?

166
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:24,845
If we don't do something,

167
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,345
they're most likely going to fail.

168
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,262
And if we want to overtake Class C,

169
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:32,470
not only do we have to stop our
class from hemorrhaging points,

170
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,637
but we've also got to do everything in our power

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,345
to start gaining them back.

172
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,220
Are you saying you want to start a study group, too?

173
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:40,845
You're willing to help Sudo, Ike,

174
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,220
and Yamauchi get good grades on the midterm?

175
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,220
Yes.

176
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:45,387
Seriously?

177
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,470
Of course. If left to their own devices,

178
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,845
they'll sink, and bring the rest of Class D with them.

179
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,929
I may have to be relegated to the lowest class in school,

180
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,387
but not for long. I will claw my way up to Class A.

181
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,720
Hey, wait a minute.

182
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:00,970
What now?

183
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,679
Did you just say you want to be Class A?

184
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:04,887
You heard right.

185
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,595
You sure you didn't mean Class C?

186
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,929
I meant what I said.

187
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,262
I find my assignment to Class D utterly offensive

188
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:13,262
and unacceptable. I intend to change it.

189
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:16,387
So, step one is to rehabilitate the failures?

190
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,262
Since you've grasped that, you can guess what's next.

191
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,512
I'd rather not.

192
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,345
Do you enjoy your lunch?

193
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,054
An extravagant meal like that doesn't come free.

194
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,345
Even an idiot could see

195
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,762
you're expected to provide something in return.

196
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,054
And don't think I've forgiven you for conspiring with

197
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,345
Kushida and taking me to that café under false pretenses.

198
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:36,012
That was foul play.

199
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,429
That's not cool.

200
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,887
If you want to make it up to me,

201
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,637
then you'll work with me to help save the whole class.

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,762
Your job will be to round up those three losers,

203
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:45,970
and convince them to join my study group.

204
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:48,470
Here's my phone number and email.

205
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,762
All right, contact me if you need anything along the way,

206
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:54,429
but don't think you can reach out whenever you want.

207
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,012
This is how I get a girl's number

208
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:02,387
for the first time in high school? Pathetic.

209
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,887
I'm not even happy that she gave it to me,

210
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,012
but I'd better save it, anyway.

211
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,679
I guess I have to comply,

212
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:14,637
even though I technically never agreed to this.

213
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,512
Well. Here goes nothin'.

214
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,554
Leave me alone.

215
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,054
Yeah... no.

216
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:24,054
The hell'd you say to me, punk?!

217
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:25,970
I knew it was hopeless.

218
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,387
Maybe I could enlist help from someone who can get through

219
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,679
to those three. I should have done that to begin with.

220
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:35,345
I wonder if she's home right now.

221
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,220
I can call her room.

222
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,804
Hi, can you connect me to Kikyo Kushida's room?

223
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,887
Yes, from Class One-D.

224
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:47,804
Yes, it is about something school-related.

225
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,387
Yes.

226
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,720
Um, hello?

227
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:55,887
Hi, this is... Hold on.

228
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,304
What's that weird noise?

229
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,095
Oh, Ayanokoji?

230
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,304
Sorry, was it too loud? I just got out of the bath.

231
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,845
I was blow-drying my hair, sorry about that.

232
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,429
You caught me a little off-guard.

233
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,637
I've never used the dorm's internal land line before,

234
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,929
so I was startled.

235
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:15,345
I'm amazed you answered.

236
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,429
Anyway, rejoice, Kushida.

237
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:20,262
I've selected you as a good will ambassador.

238
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:22,887
It's for the good of the class,
so I know you'll do your best.

239
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,262
What do you mean? Uh...

240
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,512
Right. Wow.

241
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:31,679
A second study group for Sudo, Ike, and Yamauchi?

242
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,762
Run by Horikita, herself?

243
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,179
Well, when a friend needs help, I always answer the call,

244
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:39,304
no matter what it might be. I'll do whatever it takes!

245
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,804
You don't have to, you know.

246
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,804
I think it's cruel that anyone who fails

247
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,637
gets expelled immediately.

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,387
The thought of having to say goodbye so soon, especially

249
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,220
after we just got to know each
other? I mean, that's awful.

250
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,304
Oh! I do have one request.

251
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,137
In exchange for helping you guys,

252
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,929
I want to join the study group, too.

253
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,054
Would that be okay?

254
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,887
Uh, are you sure that's all you want?

255
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,554
Yeah! I want to help the cause in any way.

256
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,095
Let's see... Oh!

257
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,679
Why don't I give you my cell phone number

258
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,304
so you can contact me whenever,

259
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,304
instead of just when I'm in my room.

260
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:11,929
You're cool with that?

261
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,345
Yeah! I mean, we're classmates, right?

262
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,429
Sorry I didn't give it to you until now.

263
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,595
I just didn't think of it.

264
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,804
You can reach out anytime you want.

265
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:25,387
I've got Kushida's phone number.

266
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:30,095
Uh? Wow, she works like lightning.

267
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,970
Good job, Kushida.

268
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,512
And... sent.

269
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:44,554
--Hel--? --No.

270
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,262
Can you at least hear me out for a minute--?

271
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,054
Are you kidding me?

272
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,512
What do you mean "what"?

273
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,679
I thought I was being perfectly clear.

274
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:20,220
You should be glad.

275
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,970
All three of them have agreed to come to the study group,

276
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,429
including Sudo!

277
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,804
Thanks to Kushida, your little plan just might work.

278
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,512
I hadn't even sent that yet!

279
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,179
I understand. Is that her final word?

280
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:40,137
Yeah. Even after you helped make it happen.

281
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,970
I'm really sorry.

282
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,762
Right! It's okay!

283
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,804
You just let me handle her from here on out.

284
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,262
Call me incompetent again!

285
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:03,554
Well, if you don't know how to solve a simple

286
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,095
simultaneous equation, I don't know how to proceed.

287
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,512
I shudder to think of what the future holds for you.

288
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,179
Sudo, stop!

289
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:13,429
Who needs algebra, anyway?

290
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,387
When am I ever gonna use it, huh?

291
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,470
If I wanted to prepare for my future, I'm better off

292
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:20,137
playing basketball to get ready for a career in the pros,

293
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,012
not sticking my nose in some book.

294
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,179
Really?

295
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:24,387
Delusional.

296
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,512
<i>You</i> playing pro basketball?

297
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,804
Do you even have an inkling of how difficult it is

298
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,304
to get to that level?

299
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,762
It requires commitment and
dedication that you sorely lack.

300
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,387
Face it, you don't have what it takes.

301
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,554
I didn't skip practice to come here and get insulted.

302
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,512
I knew this was a waste of my time.

303
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:43,220
You know what. I'm out, too.

304
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:45,762
Horikita might be smart, but
I don't want help from someone

305
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,220
so condescending. I'd rather
fail than be treated like crap.

306
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,512
Yeah, same here!

307
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,679
If you want to get expelled, be my guest.

308
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,679
See how much I care.

309
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,970
I left it to you, like you said, Kushida,

310
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:02,304
and look what happened. Do something.

311
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:05,137
Look, Horikita. No one's going to study with you

312
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,179
if you make them feel stupid when they make a mistake.

313
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,970
Yes, I can acknowledge that I was wrong about them.

314
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,095
It's clear to me that this

315
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,429
is all a fruitless waste of my time.

316
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,054
What do you mean?

317
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,845
I mean that if those idiots are
going to drag us down with them,

318
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,054
we're better off without. I say, "good riddance."

319
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,929
I see.

320
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,845
Okay, then. I'll work it out with them myself.

321
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,304
I promise.

322
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,137
I don't think we should give up on our friends so soon,

323
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,887
and it'd be sad if those three got expelled.

324
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,262
I won't abandon them, and I
think you'd rather not, either.

325
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,970
That's why you started this group in the first place.

326
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:41,679
If you're being sincere right now,

327
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:45,720
then I appreciate the sentiment. I do.

328
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,262
Tell me, why did you really agree

329
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,762
to help us in this endeavor?

330
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,345
Are you just trying to sabotage me?

331
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,054
I can't believe you. Do you really think that?

332
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,762
I'm not an underhanded person.

333
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,554
The fact that you would even assume that about me

334
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:01,887
makes me feel so sad for you.

335
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,304
It's awful, and I hope you don't mean all that.

336
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,554
I need to go get some fresh air.

337
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,179
Suzune.

338
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm amazed you had the brains to track me down.

339
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,679
Listen, brother.

340
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:38,929
I'm not the failure that I was in the past.

341
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,387
I followed you because I want to prove that I've changed.

342
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,429
That's Horikita, but who's she with?

343
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:45,929
"Brother"?

344
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,345
Prove you've changed?

345
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,387
Hardly. After all this time,

346
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,887
you clearly have not come to terms

347
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,929
with your own shortcomings.

348
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:55,762
You're foolish to think you could succeed here, leave now.

349
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,345
You're wrong! I'm going to be in Class A soon.

350
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,220
Then you'll see!

351
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,554
Don't bother.

352
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,179
I promise.

353
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,220
I know I can make it.

354
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:06,554
You're an irrational little brat.

355
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,804
The student council president?

356
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,387
Do you ever stop to think of the shame you

357
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,512
bring this family? My own little sister in Class D.

358
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,970
Pathetic.

359
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,137
Withdraw from school if you know what's good for you.

360
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,179
Brother, please just listen.

361
00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:23,137
You don't have the right to better yourself,

362
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,845
nor do you have the ability
to do so. Someday you'll learn.

363
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:31,845
Ayanokoji, don't!

364
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:33,179
Seriously?

365
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,887
You really were planning to hurt her, weren't you?

366
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,845
You better let her go, now.

367
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:41,845
Go away. This doesn't concern you.

368
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,262
She sounds like a completely different person.

369
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,220
Close one.

370
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:57,012
You fight like an expert.

371
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,220
Which of the arts do you practice?

372
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,220
Piano and calligraphy.

373
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:03,554
Ah. Now I get it.

374
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,804
I think I know who you are. I'd heard there was a student

375
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,512
who got 50s on all of his entrance exams.

376
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,970
The other day, you got a 50 on one of your quizzes

377
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:13,012
in class, as well.

378
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,137
Are you trying to make some kind of statement,

379
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,137
scoring exactly half of what you should at this school?

380
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,429
Wow, that's a strange coincidence.

381
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,845
You pride yourself on being unique, I see.

382
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,304
Suzune.

383
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,012
I'm surprised you've made a friend,

384
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,345
although I assume you had to bribe him.

385
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,512
You're wrong. He isn't my friend,

386
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:37,262
he's just a classmate. I don't
need any friends, you know that.

387
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,595
As usual, your immaturity is leading you

388
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,762
to mistake isolation for independence.

389
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,679
Anyway. If you truly wish to be in a less

390
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:49,845
humiliating class, you're going
to have to work a lot harder.

391
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:04,179
I'm sorry you had to witness all of that.

392
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:05,429
It's okay.

393
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,054
It was sort of a relief to see you acting like

394
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,887
a normal girl and not some kind of--

395
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,012
I didn't even say anything.

396
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,804
I'm impressed by your skills.

397
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,345
It's just piano and tea ceremony.

398
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:20,262
You said it was calligraphy.

399
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,512
Yeah, I do calligraphy, too.

400
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:26,845
How did you doctor your scores
on all of the entrance exams?

401
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,262
Tell the truth.

402
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:32,220
I told the truth. Coincidence.

403
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:36,595
I don't get you at all. You're such a weirdo.

404
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,054
Huh, sure.

405
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,845
So, were you serious about disbanding the study group?

406
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,429
Yes. It's a waste of my time.

407
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,470
If those losers wanna fail, that's their prerogative.

408
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,554
It makes no difference to me.

409
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:51,095
Even though failing would get them expelled?

410
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,554
I don't care what happens to anyone but me, and their exit

411
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,637
would motivate the rest of us to be better.

412
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,345
I don't see a downside to any of that.

413
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,429
Without them, it will be easier for our class to advance.

414
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,429
I don't think I could have asked for a better solution.

415
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,054
That sounds like flawed thinking.

416
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:08,804
Maybe you're just lying to yourself.

417
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,804
It's a shortcoming.

418
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,220
You make the assumption that other people hold you back,

419
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:17,679
so you always keep them at an arm's length as a rule.

420
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:20,345
Have you ever considered that your isolationist philosophy

421
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,595
might be the very thing that landed you in Class D

422
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,387
in the first place?

423
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:28,054
Ridiculous.

424
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:49,887
And so it went.

425
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,137
Everything looked hopeless.

426
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,512
Nevertheless, the day arrived.

427
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:58,095
And all of us...

428
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,929
...we students of Class One-D,

429
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:06,929
every last poor soul...

430
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:13,804
In grammar, math, chemistry, civics, English,

431
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,470
and every other classroom subject...

432
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,179
...we dodged the bullet

433
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:22,470
with higher scores than ever.
