1
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:40,353
Kiyotaka.

2
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:45,103
No matter what, you must always remember this.

3
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:49,978
To have great power and refuse to use it to your advantage

4
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,478
is something only a fool would do.

5
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,353
Hey!

6
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,895
Check out all the fish we caught!

7
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:42,645
And look at all this delicious fruit that we picked!

8
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,645
Nice work! You guys are awesome.

9
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,395
Okay, Hirata, what do you want us to do next?

10
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:49,312
If you two wouldn't mind getting the fire started,

11
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:50,645
that would be really helpful.

12
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:51,728
Sure!

13
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:52,978
Kushida, I'd like you and your group

14
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:54,520
to oversee meal rations.

15
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,895
Right!

16
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,103
Anyone else who isn't busy can come help us

17
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,853
collect drinking water.

18
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:00,895
All right, then!

19
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:02,020
Can you help me carry these?

20
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,728
Oh! Okay!

21
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,770
Yosuke Hirata.

22
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,187
Class D's unofficial leader. Huh.

23
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:22,228
It's unusual to see you take initiative like this.

24
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,812
I'm almost suspicious.

25
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,978
I have nothing better to do.

26
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,687
It helps pass the time.

27
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,978
I don't mind doing recon, but I don't wanna

28
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,187
burn undue calories I could store.

29
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,437
Stamina is valuable on a desert island.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,978
So, I don't like wandering around

31
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,687
without a clear goal in mind.

32
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,312
I understand that logic.

33
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,520
But on the flip side,

34
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,687
staying cooped up does us no good.

35
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,312
And, besides...

36
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:47,812
Next time, I'll deal with you personally.

37
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,437
I'm so looking forward to it.

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,228
It's clear that Class C has put a target on your back.

39
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,478
We've gotta be vigilant about this.

40
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:59,228
Yeah, that's true.

41
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,145
I know!

42
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:09,770
This is amazing!

43
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,187
There's so much fruit in the forest,

44
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,895
it's almost like someone planted it!

45
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,353
But if we need to, we can go fishing right here!

46
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:17,978
And the waterfalls provide all our fresh water!

47
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,187
Looks like Class B hit the jack pot.

48
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,603
You're all incredibly disciplined. I'm impressed.

49
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:26,187
It was pretty hard at first.

50
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,853
But we rigged some things up, and it's really worked out!

51
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,187
Ichinose.

52
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,478
Is it safe to assume that Class B can be trusted

53
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,062
to cooperate with Class D?

54
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:37,395
Mm-hm. That's definitely how I see it.

55
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,937
Sorry to interrupt.

56
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,270
How can I help you?

57
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:43,103
Oh, I was wondering if there was anything

58
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,395
you'd like me to do to help out.

59
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,603
Well, why not join Chihiro and the others

60
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,395
to see if there's anything they need?

61
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,353
I'd be happy to. Thank you very much.

62
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,895
He strikes me as a bit distant for someone

63
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,103
who's in your class.

64
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh, he's not. His name is Kaneda.

65
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:02,312
He got driven out of Class C because of some falling out.

66
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:04,437
So, he asked to join our camp, instead.

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,895
Oh, sorry.

68
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,145
I'd love to chat more, but there's more work to do!

69
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,103
Come visit again soon, okay?

70
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,978
As much as you know I hate to admit this,

71
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,312
this is way better than our spot.

72
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,187
I can't see inside.

73
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,312
There's a curtain over the opening of the cave.

74
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:28,687
Let's check it out.

75
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,895
What are you doing?

76
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,812
There's no reason to be intimidated by them

77
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:33,562
just because they're Class A.

78
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,353
What are you trying to achieve?

79
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,312
We don't stand to gain anything by revealing our presence.

80
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:39,687
Skulking around in the bushes

81
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,270
won't get us anywhere, either.

82
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:43,020
Might as well see what happens.

83
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,103
What do you want?

84
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,895
We came to scout your spot.

85
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,395
You got a problem with that?

86
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:58,937
Huh?

87
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,478
How very underhanded.

88
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:06,687
We're coming in.

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,770
Hey!

90
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:08,812
What?

91
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,103
This place is property of Class A.

92
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,895
You don't get to see it.

93
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,270
Oh?

94
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,228
Are you saying you've taken possession of this spot?

95
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:17,812
That's right. Go away.

96
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,812
I'm sorry, is there some rule I'm not aware of

97
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,228
that states I can't enter this cave?

98
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,978
I can't officially use an occupied spot,

99
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,520
but no one ever said I couldn't look inside.

100
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,437
That would be considered monopolizing this space.

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,145
I think you're breaking the rules.

102
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:34,228
So let me have a look, okay?

103
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,187
What do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,895
Katsuragi!

105
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,437
I don't recall giving you permission

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,770
to invite your friends.

107
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,812
Look, I only wanna see what's inside.

108
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:49,437
I can't imagine that being against the rules.

109
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,937
Well, go ahead and have a look inside, then.

110
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,228
But, be prepared for the consequences.

111
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:57,978
Each class chooses to occupy one spot on the island,

112
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:01,353
and they must defend that spot until the test is over.

113
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:05,562
If you decide to break this unwritten rule,

114
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:07,937
then that will mean war.

115
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:14,520
You'd be better off to avoid that kind of trouble.

116
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,270
I think you need to reapply sunscreen.

117
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:24,562
One, two, three, you're gone!

118
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,395
You've got to be kidding me.

119
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,812
What in the world does Class C think they're doing?

120
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,228
Um.

121
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:39,520
Ryuen wants to talk to you guys.

122
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,145
Hey, there.

123
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,395
You all seem to be living the high life.

124
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,687
Oh, we are doing exactly that.

125
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,353
It's our summer vacation, after all.

126
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,187
Why shouldn't we enjoy it?

127
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,895
Right?

128
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:50,603
Uh--

129
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:51,895
That's right!

130
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,687
An incompetent leader only ends up

131
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,853
hurting his subjects.

132
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,395
Ishizaki.

133
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,978
Yes, sir?

134
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,478
It's warm.

135
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:03,353
I'm very sorry, sir.

136
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:06,145
For a measly one or 200 class points.

137
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,020
The rest of you are willing to endure starvation,

138
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,228
heat, exhaustion.

139
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,437
The very thought of it makes me wanna laugh.

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,103
I was dumb to come here with my guard up

141
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,812
against a fool like you.

142
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:24,062
Who's the real fool here? Is it me?

143
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:25,770
Or is it you?

144
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,520
Ryuen, sir.

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,645
This is the way that I operate,

146
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,937
and I refuse to settle for anything less than that.

147
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,520
I see. Well then, do whatever you want.

148
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:45,603
It's way better for us if you're out of the game.

149
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:49,437
Oh, there was one other thing I wanted to ask you.

150
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
You're familiar with Ibuki, aren't you?

151
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,478
Of course, she's in our class.

152
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,103
So? What's it to you?

153
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,520
Her face was messed up pretty badly.

154
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,103
Do you know how it may have gotten that way?

155
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,437
Disobedient servants are of no use to a ruler.

156
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,145
I only doled out the appropriate punishment.

157
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,062
You used up all of your S-points

158
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,978
on the first day, didn't you?

159
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,728
That's exactly right.

160
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:19,812
I spent all our class's S-points yesterday.

161
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:21,562
So it doesn't really matter.

162
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,728
Ibuki can do what she wants
and it won't affect our S-points.

163
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,228
The rules state that, even if you lose

164
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,895
all 300 of your S-points, you can't ever

165
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:34,395
get into negative numbers. He used that to his advantage.

166
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,270
A simplistic way of thinking.

167
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,270
I guess you don't mind losing all the class points

168
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:39,645
we were offered.

169
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,270
Forget all of that.

170
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:43,645
Why don't you just come play with me?

171
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:47,145
I'll prepare a special tent for us, Suzune.

172
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:49,395
Let's get out of here, Ayanokoji.

173
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:52,645
If I stay any longer, this guy's gonna make me vomit.

174
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,562
Suzune, come back when you're ready

175
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,145
to have the time of your life. You know you want to.

176
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:01,812
I'll blow your mind if you
would just give me the afternoon.

177
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,603
Absurd, isn't it?

178
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,645
But their bad decision benefits us.

179
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:12,770
Yeah.

180
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,312
In this test, you need to conserve

181
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:16,645
any way that you can, or there's no way

182
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,270
you'll last the whole week.

183
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,103
He's not planning to last the whole week,

184
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,145
which is the reason he did what he did.

185
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:23,728
What do you mean by that?

186
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,603
It's pretty simple.

187
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,353
He'll do exactly what Koenji did.

188
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,478
Cut any losses and run.

189
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,937
All they have to do is claim to be sick,

190
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,270
or that they can't handle the stress.

191
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:35,895
Then they can all go back to the ship

192
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:39,020
and enjoy the rest of their summer vacation in comfort.

193
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,937
Hold on, so you're telling me that he never

194
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,770
had any intention of participating in the test?

195
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,937
Well, this exam is about freedom of choice, isn't it?

196
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,603
Ryuen might have the best answer.

197
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,562
After all, he chose comfort.

198
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,645
I don't know. That's beyond me.

199
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:57,645
A zero point strategy. Fascinating.

200
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,770
Good morning to you, Hirata.

201
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,937
Oh, morning, Ayanokoji.

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,645
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

203
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:04,145
No, you didn't.

204
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,728
It's just hard for me to sleep very well

205
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,145
in this kind of environment.

206
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,520
My back is killing me.

207
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,020
That feels great.

208
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,520
It must be stressful to be the one

209
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,270
keeping the class together.

210
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,978
I only do it because I enjoy it.

211
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,937
If I didn't, there is no way I'd take that on.

212
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,478
I just like seeing the class happy.

213
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,687
Are you really sure you wanna be paired up with me?

214
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,895
Yeah. I'm sorry.

215
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,020
I know that I can be a total drag when we're searching.

216
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,770
And you're not the least bit worried?

217
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,228
People might start to talk about us.

218
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:58,895
No, I couldn't care less about it,

219
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,312
to tell you the truth. And, anyway.

220
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,770
When we first set out on the cruise,

221
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,603
I was feeling really down in the dumps about it.

222
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,562
I don't have a single friend so,

223
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:13,353
I didn't see how a cruise could be any fun.

224
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,562
But now... Now, I'm having a good time.

225
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,228
I'm actually happy that I came.

226
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,103
I see.

227
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:25,853
Man, it's too bad.

228
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,312
If I had my camera right now,

229
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,728
I could take an amazing picture of you.

230
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,062
Weird.

231
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,270
I wonder where they all could have gone to.

232
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:41,020
Ayanokoji, were you out on recon, too?

233
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,937
No, we were just out exploring the forest.

234
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
And we ended up here on the beach.

235
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,187
Aw. I'm so disappointed.

236
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,228
I was hoping to get an idea of who Class C's leader is.

237
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:53,062
The primary goal here is to amass

238
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,978
as many S-points as possible.

239
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:58,645
Too bad Ryuen gave up, and so, he lost everything.

240
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,103
The straightforward approach is definitely

241
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,145
the best strategy for us.

242
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:05,187
Ichinose.

243
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,978
There's something I've been wanting to ask you about.

244
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,187
What's that?

245
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,687
Well, Katsuragi from Class A.

246
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,478
Do you know anything about him?

247
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,645
You're interested in Katsuragi?

248
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,353
Well, I know that Sakayanagi is
sitting out the test completely.

249
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,812
So Katsuragi has now taken

250
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:22,645
temporary leadership over Class A.

251
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,728
Katsuragi's an intelligent guy.

252
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,520
Even with Sakayanagi gone,

253
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:29,312
I doubt Class A will suffer much internal discord.

254
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,520
Although...

255
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,562
I doubt anyone who is on Sakayanagi's side

256
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:34,062
is having a very good time.

257
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:37,187
Those two are opposite extremes, after all.

258
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,645
Opposite extremes?

259
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,603
A reformist and a conservative, essentially.

260
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,520
Their approach to everything is the polar opposite,

261
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,812
and I hear they're always butting heads over that.

262
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,770
Sakayanagi.

263
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,520
Looks like we made it through another day!

264
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,645
By the way,

265
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,270
I thought I saw all the Class C people

266
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,978
heading to the ship this afternoon.

267
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:01,020
Hirata, you know anything about that?

268
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,978
No. I wish I did.

269
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:05,187
They probably just got sick of the island life

270
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,228
and decided to quit and head back to the ship.

271
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:08,853
You think the whole class did?

272
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,478
Can they even do that?

273
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:13,145
Why would I know any better than you do?

274
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,103
Hey.

275
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,728
Are you going to head back to the ship?

276
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,687
The last thing I wanna look at is those jerks' faces.

277
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,395
So I am going to stay here.

278
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:27,020
Seems kinda suspicious, doesn't it?

279
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,353
Sudo, don't.

280
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:29,562
Hey.

281
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,187
Do you know anything about what they planned?

282
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,228
Huh? No, leave me alone.

283
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:34,437
Hold it!

284
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,978
You keep your filthy hands off me!

285
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,770
What the heck is your problem?

286
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,603
We helped you, so you owe us one.

287
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,520
Or, did you conveniently forget about that?

288
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:44,103
I didn't even ask for your help, remember?

289
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:47,187
Your people just forced their help upon me.

290
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,270
Wasting your points on an enemy? Idiots.

291
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:51,770
--Say that again! --Sudo!

292
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,145
Go ahead and hit me, then!

293
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,853
Both of you need to calm down.

294
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:57,520
This isn't the time for us to
start fighting among friends.

295
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,145
We're friends? How stupid can you be?

296
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,645
Ibuki. Are you okay?

297
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:08,187
Damn it! What's her problem?

298
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,728
Hey, you guys!

299
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:18,853
Guys, wake up already, come on!

300
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,353
Seriously, get up, now!

301
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,353
What's going on?

302
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:30,187
Look, Hirata. I've got bad news!

303
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,645
What could it possibly be? It's so early.

304
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:37,020
This probably has nothing to do with you, Hirata.

305
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,062
But there's something we need

306
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:40,437
to get to the bottom of right now.

307
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,603
This morning, Karuizawa's underwear

308
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,145
went missing from her bag.

309
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:48,145
She's in our tent right now, bawling her eyes out.

310
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,437
Kushida and the others are trying to comfort her

311
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,395
to no avail.

312
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,978
Hold on. What are you saying?

313
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,187
You can't possibly suspect--!

314
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,562
Well, why shouldn't we suspect you?

315
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,562
One of you obviously snuck in and stole them

316
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,395
in the middle of the night!

317
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,020
You've got to be kidding.

318
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,937
It was probably that Ibuki girl trying to frame us!

319
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,853
A girl would never do something like that!

320
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,312
But how can you be so sure?

321
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,145
Look, the point is, we refuse to camp

322
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:08,937
in the same place as an underwear-thieving pervert!

323
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,603
Hey, everyone, just calm down for a minute.

324
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:14,562
What proof do you have that one of the Class D boys

325
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:15,978
stole the underwear, anyway?

326
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,687
That's why we came to you.

327
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,228
We trust you to find the culprit for us.

328
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:22,187
You want me to do it?

329
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,020
To begin, we request to conduct a search

330
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:26,728
of all the boys' bags!

331
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay, fine.

332
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:31,103
But to protect their privacy, will you agree to allow me

333
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,478
to conduct the search, instead of you guys?

334
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,603
Come on. I'm startin' to get pissed off.

335
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:40,937
They don't even have any evidence

336
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,520
that a boy actually did it. It's crazy!

337
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:46,895
What's wrong?

338
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,270
Uh, nothing.

339
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,020
Wait just a minute.

340
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,770
You're the one who stole them, aren't you?

341
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,145
Dumbass! No, man, I'm not!

342
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:58,645
Uh-huh. No way. Don't tell me that...

343
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:01,312
Of course not. Don't start suspecting me!

344
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:02,728
Show me what you've got in there!

345
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,103
Cut it out! I'm innocent, I swear.

346
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:05,645
I didn't do anything!

347
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,520
Caught red-handed!

348
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:11,853
No! I don't know how they got there, I promise!

349
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,770
It wasn't me, dude. I swear it wasn't!

350
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,187
No need to lie,

351
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,020
everyone's got their kinks, man.

352
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:18,853
I don't know how they got in my bag!

353
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,228
Hey, you!

354
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,145
You believe I'm innocent here, don't you?

355
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,603
Under the current circumstances...

356
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,395
I can't say with any level of certainty

357
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,645
that you're not the culprit.

358
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,895
A-Ayanokoji, why?

359
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,353
But, if you were,

360
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:37,020
I don't think you'd be so careless. You'd cover it up.

361
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,270
You're right!

362
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,853
So, you think someone else

363
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,187
planted the panties in Ike's bag?

364
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,478
Yeah!

365
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,145
That's gotta be what happened, don'tcha think?

366
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:47,770
Hey! Hurry, it up!

367
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,687
What do I do? What do I do?

368
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,478
I'm in major trouble!

369
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:54,020
Good luck, man!

370
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:56,020
Uh--

371
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,145
You're gonna have to hide them somewhere.

372
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:01,145
Oh, will I? Hide them where? Help me out!

373
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,728
If you think hiding them is the best idea,

374
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:04,520
then you hide them yourself, smarty-pants!

375
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,687
Hold on. I didn't mean--

376
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,187
I'll be right there!

377
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,812
Huh. You're kidding me.

378
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:16,437
We searched all the bags.

379
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,437
For real?

380
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,603
Mm-hm. So, now we know.

381
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,187
None of the boys here were behind the theft.

382
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,978
We can let them put their stuff away now, right?

383
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:27,145
And then we can talk about the next step.

384
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,978
I demand a pat-down.

385
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:30,312
Uh--?

386
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:32,645
An underwear thief must have a very deviant mind.

387
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,812
No telling where he might be keeping them.

388
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:35,812
What?

389
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:37,187
Could you give us a break already?

390
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,395
Ike's been acting suspicious this whole time.

391
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,520
You think he's the one who did it?

392
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:40,562
So gross!

393
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,937
Fine, have it your way.

394
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,187
Why don't you guys just search me, then?

395
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,728
No, don't lead the conversation down that path.

396
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,103
Yes, why don't we?

397
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,103
Hirata. Go ahead.

398
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,437
This is the worst thing that could happen.

399
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,103
There's no way of talking myself out of it.

400
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,478
I'd be better off if I just told the truth.

401
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,270
They might believe me.

402
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:08,062
Sorry. I'll make this as quick as possible.

403
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:13,478
It's over.

404
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,228
Ayanokoji doesn't have them, either.

405
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,645
So you can rest assured it wasn't one of us.

406
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:24,228
Really? Well, if you say so, I can trust it.

407
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:25,478
Thanks.

408
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,770
Right.

409
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:32,312
I'll let the others know, if that's okay with you.

410
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,687
Yeah. See you later, then.

411
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:40,020
Hirata. Can we talk for a sec?

412
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,978
Why didn't you tell them what you found?

413
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,812
I thought so. That was the underwear, then?

414
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,312
Yeah.

415
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,603
Did you take them, Ayanokoji?

416
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,478
No. I didn't.

417
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,478
Good, I believe you.

418
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:05,228
You aren't the kind of person
who'd do something like that.

419
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,937
Well, that's quite a relief, but I think

420
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,353
it would be best if I took those off your hands.

421
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,145
Are you sure?

422
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,853
Yeah, it's the only way.

423
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:18,103
I'll suffer least for being the culprit.

424
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:20,145
I'm her boyfriend, after all.

425
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:25,020
I really do believe you didn't do it, Ayanokoji.

426
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:28,478
That's why I saved you.

427
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:31,187
And, the way you answer won't change that,

428
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,353
but I just have to ask. Will you find the actual culprit?

429
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,978
Me, help find the culprit?

430
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,395
Yes.

431
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:45,978
Well, I'll try my absolute best to, at least.

432
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,187
Thanks a lot.

433
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,062
And if you do, will you let me be the first to know?

434
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,270
Please?

435
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,395
I don't want anybody else to hear about it.

436
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,312
So I need you to promise that you'll tell me

437
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:57,895
before anyone else.

438
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:01,770
Are you asking me to help you
cover up the truth in all this?

439
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,603
"Cover up the truth." Huh.

440
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:07,395
Yeah, I guess that is what I'm asking.

441
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:09,687
Because, no matter who it is,

442
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,312
I think it would be best for us to bury the real story.

443
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,520
I don't want everything to be ruined over this.

444
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:22,062
So that's why

445
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,895
I would like your mind working with me on it.
