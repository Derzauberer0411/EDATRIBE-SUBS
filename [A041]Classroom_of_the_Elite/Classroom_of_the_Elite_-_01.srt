1
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:15,629
If I may,

2
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:18,421
I'd like to pose an interesting question:

3
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:21,712
are all human beings truly equal?

4
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:23,171
These days, everywhere you go,

5
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:25,337
there's talk about the fight for equality.

6
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,712
As a wise man once said,

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,379
"Heaven does not create one
person above or below another."

8
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:34,671
People like to throw his words around.

9
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,629
But that's not the whole quote.

10
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:39,504
He goes on to say that, while we are all equal at birth,

11
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:42,129
pretty soon, things begin to change.

12
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:44,504
Academic effort is what sets some people apart,

13
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:47,712
to rise above the others.

14
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:52,796
At any rate, humans change
over time based on their actions.

15
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,712
Truth be told, at the end of the day,

16
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:58,462
"equality" is just a fantasy,
and most of us go through life

17
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:01,462
denying the fact that we live in a meritocracy.

18
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,171
Um, excuse me, sir.

19
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:06,087
Would you be willing to give up your seat?

20
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:07,796
Mm?

21
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,587
That is priority seating, after all,

22
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,921
so it would only be right for you

23
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,796
to let this older woman sit there.

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,087
My, my, you're a pretty girl.

25
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,004
I understand that this is priority seating, honey,

26
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,504
but there's no law forcing me to give it up.

27
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:24,462
You think I should have to stand
up just because I'm still young?

28
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:28,254
Ha, ha. What a bunch of ageist nonsense.

29
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:29,796
Sure, I'm younger than her,

30
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,754
but standing uses way more energy than sitting.

31
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:36,754
Tell me. Why must I sacrifice
my health for this lady's sake?

32
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:40,587
Because, you'd be contributing
to the greater good of humanity.

33
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,129
And just take a look at her,

34
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,129
she's having trouble staying upright.

35
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,212
I have zero interest in contributing

36
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,379
to the greater good. And anyway,

37
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,712
there are plenty of other jerks on this bus

38
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:53,587
who could give up their seats.

39
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,379
Furthermore, I don't see much difference

40
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:57,504
between a priority seat and a regular one.

41
00:01:57,587 --> 00:01:59,921
So ask someone else to be a hero.

42
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,421
To tell the truth, dear.

43
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,879
I don't mind standing, don't worry.

44
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,879
But thank you, all the same.

45
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,087
Excuse me!

46
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,921
Would anyone on this bus be willing to give up

47
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:13,504
their seat to this sweet lady?

48
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,254
Over here. I'll stand.

49
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,421
Thank you very much, ma'am!

50
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:51,087
Well, this is it. My new school.

51
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:56,421
Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School.

52
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:58,421
Established by the government to raise students

53
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:00,879
who have been deemed our country's future leaders:

54
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,046
movers and shakers, if you will.

55
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,462
And it works, too.

56
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:07,796
It boasts 100% college entry and employment rates.

57
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,462
Using experimental, state-derived teaching methods,

58
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:13,171
they pull out all the stops to
build a bright future for Japan.

59
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:14,546
Hey, you.

60
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,837
I noticed you staring at me on the bus earlier.

61
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,546
Why was that?

62
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,671
Oh. I'm sorry.

63
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,171
I was just curious,

64
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:29,337
'cause well, you didn't want to give up your seat, either.

65
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,837
I was wondering if, like me, you'd rather stay out of it.

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,712
I'm nothing like you.

67
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,921
In my case, I stayed silent as a matter of principle.

68
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,171
Uh-huh?

69
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,212
That makes her worse than me.

70
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:43,504
If that's all, goodbye.

71
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:51,629
And now, a few words

72
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:53,921
from our student council president.

73
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:56,837
Thank you for the introduction.

74
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,879
I'm Manabu Horikita. Newcomers, as a representative

75
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:04,837
of the upperclassmen, and your student council president,

76
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,962
I extend a warm welcome to you all.

77
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:10,504
As I am sure you're aware, our school is known for

78
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,004
its prestige and distinction on all fronts,

79
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,629
and boasts impeccable employment and college entry rates

80
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,004
across the board. We take pride in this.

81
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:21,129
In fact, it's our school's number one priority, and we all

82
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,296
work together to uphold this standard of excellence.

83
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,004
Now you are a part of that, too.

84
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,087
We expect greatness from all of you,

85
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,296
and we know you're capable...

86
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,879
We're even in the same class?

87
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,671
...so you alone control your path.

88
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:37,879
Heh! Wow, me, too! So, what's your favorite genre.

89
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:39,212
Romance, I bet!

90
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,796
Huh? Romance is my favorite!

91
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,504
How could you have known?

92
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:45,337
Seriously! <i>Shojo</i> manga is definitely mine.

93
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,712
Uh... My favorite genre is definitely Mystery.

94
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,921
Mystery?

95
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:51,171
It keeps me on the edge of my seat!

96
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:53,629
She has the seat next to me?

97
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,504
An annoying coincidence.

98
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,004
The feeling's mutual.

99
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:59,754
Hey, guys! Listen up for a sec.

100
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,212
We should go around the room and introduce ourselves.

101
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,087
Start to get familiar with each other.

102
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,296
I'd like to get to know you guys.

103
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,962
Plus, the teacher isn't here yet, so we might as well.

104
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,046
Does that sound okay?

105
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,129
I'm in!

106
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,712
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

107
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,129
I agree.

108
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,296
I mean, how else are we all going to get acquainted.

109
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,671
I'm glad to hear it.

110
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,296
Well, I guess I'll go first, then. I'm Yosuke Hirata.

111
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,921
But you can just call me Yosuke, if you want.

112
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:26,004
I play every sport imaginable,

113
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,421
and I'm gonna try out for the
school's soccer team, for sure.

114
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,254
Thanks! Nice to meet you all.

115
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,629
That was great.

116
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,712
I bet that guy's going to be the leader in class.

117
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,171
Okay, I guess I'll go next!

118
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,629
Hi, my name is Kikyo Kushida.

119
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,046
My goal is to become friends

120
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,546
with every person in the entire school!

121
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,712
That obviously includes everyone here.

122
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:49,296
So, if you're going out, please consider inviting me!

123
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,504
She'll have no trouble reaching that goal.

124
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,962
She's got that "everyone's friend" vibe going on.

125
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:01,254
But I shouldn't be focused on her at a time like this.

126
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,129
These introductions are going to determine

127
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,671
everyone's standing in class.

128
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:07,962
Should I try to crack a joke?

129
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,546
Then, in middle school...

130
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,212
I bet I could get a laugh if I acted really hyper.

131
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,504
But I'd just end up creeping people out.

132
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:18,754
Anyway, it's not like I have any real interests

133
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,504
or hobbies to speak of.

134
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:23,171
I'm kinda like a free agent, a blank slate.

135
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:26,837
Next up! How about you?

136
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,837
Uh. Who, me?

137
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,462
No getting out of this one.

138
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,796
I'd better muster up the energy
to stand up and say something,

139
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,504
for the sake of my reputation.

140
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,629
Uh... So, um...

141
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,879
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji.

142
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,129
Uh... I can't wait to study with you.

143
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:56,337
Uh. Uh... I'm not really good at anything in particular.

144
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,587
Uh. I'll do my best to get along with you all.

145
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,212
I blew it.

146
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,379
Ayanokoji, well it's nice to meet you.

147
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,004
I can't wait to be friends.

148
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,212
Hmph.

149
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,504
She just laughed at me.

150
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:17,504
Okay, who's next?

151
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,337
Introductions are for grade schoolers.

152
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,171
What are we, a buncha babies?

153
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:25,587
Get to know each other on your own time.

154
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,421
Let's get started.

155
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,546
Find your seats, everyone.

156
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:38,087
I'm Sae Chabashira, the homeroom teacher for Class One-D.

157
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,671
At this school, you will not change classes.

158
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,837
Ever. For the next three years,

159
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,629
I'll be responsible for you until graduation.

160
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:48,879
For our first order of business: the school rulebook.

161
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,212
Take one and pass them back.

162
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,129
We have some rather unique rules

163
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,046
at this institution.

164
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,879
First, you must all live in the dorms.

165
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:01,879
Your contact with the outside world will be restricted,

166
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,879
as will your time away from the campus.

167
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,671
For anyone concerned,

168
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:10,337
the school offers a wide variety of facilities.

169
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,379
Anything you could need or want can be found here.

170
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:16,129
Including leisure and entertainment.

171
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,337
To make purchases, you will spend your points,

172
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:21,171
which are tracked using the school's main computer system.

173
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:23,879
At this school, you can buy absolutely anything

174
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,921
on campus with these.

175
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,671
Points are distributed to you on the first of each month.

176
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:31,587
Each point is worth one yen.

177
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,504
If you'll all check your devices,

178
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,796
you'll notice that you've already been allotted 100,000.

179
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,962
We what?!

180
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,462
Are you kidding me?

181
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,546
I see you're all surprised

182
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,337
by the size of your allotment.

183
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,962
This school judges its students
based on their merit alone.

184
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:51,504
You've all shown immense value
just getting into this school.

185
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:54,462
We've allotted you what we think you are worth.

186
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:58,629
Thank you very much, come again!

187
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,671
It really does work exactly like money.

188
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:05,671
Twenty-five students per class,
and four classes per grade.

189
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,212
That makes 300 of us in all.

190
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,712
If each kid gets 100,000 a month,

191
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:14,212
that's 360 million per year.

192
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:17,629
How can the government afford to pay for all this?

193
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:18,796
Huh?

194
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,337
Another annoying coincidence, it seems.

195
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:25,629
You don't have to be so prickly.

196
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,921
Well, since we have to sit by each other,

197
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,046
we should attempt to get along.

198
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,504
What's your name?

199
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:39,129
Really, you won't even share with me that much?

200
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,546
So? You got a problem with that?

201
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,171
No, but it would make things
weird for the next three years.

202
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,879
To sit next to ya and never know your name.

203
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,796
It's Suzune Horikita.

204
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,504
"Horikita"?

205
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,754
Like the guy who spoke earlier?

206
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:02,712
Why are you buying all cheap stuff?

207
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,296
You've got lots of money.

208
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,629
You could stand to buy more expensive--

209
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,462
I don't need all that.

210
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,004
--Yeah, but you could-- --I told you.

211
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:10,962
I don't need that stuff.

212
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,462
Right.

213
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,712
You're weird.

214
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,962
You aren't very good at interacting with people.

215
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:17,962
No conversation skills.

216
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,546
Yeah, I know.

217
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,962
But you don't seem to be much better than I am.

218
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,212
That's true.

219
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:24,879
But I'm not the one who said they were going to

220
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:28,754
"work hard to get along" with everyone else.

221
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,254
These are free?

222
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:31,879
Maybe that's for people who use up all their

223
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,462
points before the first of the month, I guess.

224
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,837
How could one use up a 100,000 points?

225
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,129
This school is too indulgent.

226
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:40,504
You think you're better than me? Huh?

227
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,421
Maybe. You are in Class One-D, aren't you?

228
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,962
Yeah. What the hell does it matter to you guys?!

229
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,796
Hey, now that's no way to talk to your elders.

230
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,546
You better learn some respect, and fast.

231
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:51,921
Shut up!

232
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:54,254
Huh? Wait, isn't that guy in our class?

233
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,337
Maybe, but I won't get involved.

234
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,587
It's beneath my dignity.

235
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,421
Heh. We'll let it slide this time.

236
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,379
Class D has already got it bad.

237
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,379
If we knocked you down a peg, you'd fall right off.

238
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,962
Don't you run away from me!

239
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:08,879
Go ahead.

240
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:10,587
Scream your head off if you want.

241
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,671
You people are already in for a world of pain.

242
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,046
"A world of pain"?

243
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,337
Those damn wimps!

244
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,254
Hm?

245
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,546
Not long after that,

246
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,671
the class began to split up into cliques.

247
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:44,837
Hey, Kikyo.

248
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,671
You wanna eat lunch together today?

249
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,087
I'm sorry. I can't. I've got too much to do.

250
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,546
This beauty was a mere 80,000 points!

251
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,296
We get a 100,000 more soon, so it was a steal!

252
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,212
Yeah, I've bought tons of games! This is awesome!

253
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,421
I saw an adorable pair of earrings!

254
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:01,254
Wanna stop by after class?

255
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,004
Let's shop for clothes, too!

256
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,421
Unlike everyone else,

257
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,296
I failed to make any friends.

258
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,546
You're pathetic.

259
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,337
Hm?

260
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,546
Yeah, well, you're alone, too.

261
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,462
That's true. But I, for one, prefer to be alone.

262
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:22,046
I'm gonna hit up the cafeteria.

263
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,337
Um. Your name is Ayanokoji, isn't it?

264
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:29,587
Yeah. And you're...

265
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:30,546
...Kushida?

266
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,004
I'm so impressed!

267
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,421
You remembered my name, too! Thanks.

268
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,921
Yeah. Guess I did.

269
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:41,337
So, um. Could we talk for a sec?

270
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,421
The reason I stopped you is that

271
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,796
you and Horikita seem really close.

272
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,296
Well... I wouldn't go that far.

273
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,879
Really?

274
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:59,462
But, you're the only person in
school that she talks to, ever.

275
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,212
It's my goal to become friends with everyone at school,

276
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,754
even outside our class.

277
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:05,921
So I asked Horikita for her phone number

278
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:09,962
to maybe call her sometime, but she turned me down.

279
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,962
She said she doesn't wanna be friends with anyone.

280
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,087
Yeah, I think that's just how she is.

281
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,921
But I still want to be friends with Horikita,

282
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,504
in spite of all that!

283
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,837
Do you think that you could help me with her?

284
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:22,004
Help you?

285
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,212
I don't know.

286
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:26,421
You mean... you won't?

287
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,296
The head of the Yamato government

288
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,879
was known as the " <i>O-kimi</i> ."

289
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:34,587
He controlled the powerful families of each region

290
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,504
using the <i>uji-kabane</i> system.

291
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,629
" <i>Uji</i> " referred to groups of families

292
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:40,587
who shared the same bloodline,

293
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:44,421
while " <i>kabane</i> " referred to
an individual's post and status.

294
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,671
It was a system in which pedigree determined one's place.

295
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,462
That's all for today.

296
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:54,087
Look over the material for tomorrow.

297
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:05,754
This school is incredibly indulgent.

298
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:08,212
These kids play around and sleep in class,

299
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,712
but the teachers never even bother to do anything.

300
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,712
I can't believe the government has the gall

301
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:14,546
to dub this an elite school.

302
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,921
Maybe they're just trying to
encourage individual autonomy.

303
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,421
Perhaps.

304
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:24,087
Hey. If you're just gonna head home,

305
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,837
would you mind coming somewhere with me first?

306
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,921
What are you trying to pull?

307
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,379
It's an invitation.

308
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:32,462
Why would that suggest an ulterior motive?

309
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,796
If you'll be honest and tell me what you really want,

310
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,837
maybe I'll be willing to hear you out.

311
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,546
You know that big café in the mall, the coffee place?

312
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,546
Where all the girls like to hang out?

313
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,462
Would you be willing to go there with me right now?

314
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:46,587
Why me, of all people?

315
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:49,546
I'm just not brave enough to go in there alone.

316
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,337
The place kind of has a "no boys allowed" vibe.

317
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:54,421
And there's no one else you can ask?

318
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:56,754
Well, no, I suppose there isn't.

319
00:14:56,837 --> 00:15:00,004
Hurts to admit it, but... you're right about that.

320
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,504
Is it always so packed?

321
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:16,879
So this is your first time coming here, too?

322
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,879
Oh, right, you're a loner.

323
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,629
Trying to insult me? How childish.

324
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,212
Uh. That table just opened up.

325
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:29,587
Hey, I wonder.

326
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,254
You think the other people in here see us,

327
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,337
well, you know, as a couple--

328
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,504
Never mind, probably not.

329
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,796
The impending confrontation

330
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,046
is tying my stomach into knots. I feel sick.

331
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,462
Huh?! Horikita!

332
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,754
What a coincidence! And Ayanokoji, too?

333
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:50,171
So, do you two come here together often?

334
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,129
No, this is our first time.

335
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,337
Oh, that's cool.

336
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,379
Well, I'm here by myself--

337
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,254
I'm leaving.

338
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,879
You are? We literally just sat down.

339
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,462
But Kushida's here now.

340
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,629
So you don't need me to stay, do you?

341
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,754
I guess not, but Kushida and I

342
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:06,629
are just classmates, we don't know each other.

343
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,462
And how is that any different than what you and I are?

344
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:11,129
On top of that...

345
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,629
Something seems fishy here, and I don't like it.

346
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,421
What? Oh, come on!

347
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:17,962
It's a coincidence.

348
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,962
Nice try, but the correct response

349
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,504
would have been, "What's that supposed to mean?"

350
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:24,837
The girls who were at this table,

351
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,629
and the two at the next one over,

352
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:29,046
is it coincidence they're in our class?

353
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,421
Honestly.

354
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,171
Wow, I didn't even notice.

355
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,421
I'm impressed that you recognized them.

356
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:37,754
You and I came straight here
immediately after class ended.

357
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,546
We came in, and then they left, though they couldn't have

358
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,754
been here for longer than a couple of minutes.

359
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,129
It doesn't make any sense.

360
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,337
Well, um...

361
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,921
Sorry. Yeah, you're right. We set you up.

362
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:54,629
I thought so.

363
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,879
Horikita! Please be my friend.

364
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,796
That's all I wanted from this!

365
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,587
Well, what I want is for you to leave me alone.

366
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:04,087
You two should both know that you're wasting your time.

367
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:07,046
Huh? But I, I don't understand.

368
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,087
Won't you be lonely all by yourself?

369
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:13,212
Being alone is not synonymous with being lonely.

370
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:14,921
Like I said, it's a waste.

371
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,462
Every sound coming out of your mouth repulses me.

372
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:20,129
Hey. Are you sure about this?

373
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:21,587
Do you really want to spend the next

374
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,296
three years of your life that way?

375
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:25,712
If you don't make friends, you'll be isolated.

376
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,712
I've been completely alone for the past nine years,

377
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:32,379
so what's another three to me? It hardly matters.

378
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:37,587
Sorry. I kinda think I might have made Horikita hate you,

379
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,462
and that was the last thing I wanted.

380
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,962
Nah, don't worry about it.

381
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:46,171
Maybe she and I will never be friends.

382
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,962
That makes me sad.

383
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,087
If I can't even make friends with all my classmates,

384
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,504
my goal seems unattainable.

385
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:58,754
Personally, I think Horikita's an exception.

386
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,962
Uh! That's Ichinose over there!

387
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,421
Honami Ichinose is from Class One-B.

388
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:06,504
We became friends yesterday.

389
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,546
You're friends with kids in other classes?

390
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,254
I can't even imagine that.

391
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:14,712
Mm-hm. There are so many really nice people in Class B.

392
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:17,921
You know. This school is pretty amazing, don't you think?

393
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,254
All the different shops,

394
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:22,379
and the fact that we get a 100,000 yen every month!

395
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:23,796
I don't know.

396
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,546
That amount seems kind of excessive, in my opinion.

397
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,004
Yeah. I'm glad you think so, too.

398
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,296
And, calling them points makes
them entirely too easy to spend.

399
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,296
To be honest, it's skewing my money sense.

400
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:36,504
Hm.

401
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:42,129
I'm going to have to budget tightly to avoid overspending.

402
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,754
I mean, I'll buy the things I need, obviously.

403
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:48,212
The toiletries I use every day, like soap and toothpaste,

404
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:51,754
and I'll need panties.

405
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,796
Yeah. Horikita was saying something similar.

406
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,587
Huh? Oh! So you even know

407
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,879
all about how she spends her money.

408
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:02,379
You two really are friends, aren't you?

409
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,629
No, I just happened to be there.

410
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,296
Whoa. She's standing so close.

411
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:15,712
Well! We'll just have to leave it at that!

412
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,171
But it happens to be the truth.

413
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:33,212
One hundred thousand... Huh.

414
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,129
Most students decided

415
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:38,212
to make the most of their circumstances

416
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:41,421
without giving much thought to anything at all.

417
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:44,629
Day in and day out they blew
through their monthly allowance

418
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:47,462
like it was nothing, buying whatever they wanted.

419
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:49,254
The teacher never disciplined,

420
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,754
so conversations in class, sleeping on desks, tardiness,

421
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,379
and downright truancy became the norm.

422
00:19:55,462 --> 00:20:00,754
Extravagance, debauchery, and lethargy ran rampant.

423
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:04,712
Then, suddenly, on May first, everything changed.

424
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:07,087
Huh? What's going on?

425
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,837
Hold on, yours hasn't, either?

426
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:10,462
What's the deal here?

427
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,546
Take your seats, class.

428
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:18,087
Morning homeroom begins now.

429
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,254
Hey, teacher?

430
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,921
Nobody here has gotten any more points yet.

431
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:25,296
It's the first of the month.

432
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:27,712
Shouldn't they have already been refilled by now?

433
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,337
Of course, this month's allotment

434
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,421
has already been distributed.

435
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,254
Uh...

436
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:34,879
Mine aren't there.

437
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:37,629
As I said, the points have been allocated.

438
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,546
I am certain about that.

439
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,296
And I know for a fact that this class

440
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,587
has not been overlooked by the administration.

441
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:46,421
What about our points? Nobody in this class got any.

442
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:53,254
A whole class comprised of morons.

443
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,879
You're all pathetic.

444
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:59,754
A combined total of 98 tardies and absences,

445
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:03,462
391 documented cases of cell-phone use,

446
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:05,796
and or talking during instruction.

447
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:08,962
Impressive figures for the first month of the school year.

448
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:12,129
At this school, your grades and performance evaluations

449
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:13,546
aren't handed out.

450
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:16,171
They're reflected in your monthly points allotment.

451
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:20,212
Your unconscionable behavior, and that alone, has resulted

452
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,837
in the with holding of your
points allowance for this month.

453
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,004
The points allotted to this class for the month

454
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,629
comes out to a total... of zero.

455
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,296
No way. I have to live on no money this whole month?

456
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,337
Hang on. That's not fair.

457
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,671
It's just that... You should have told us.

458
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,671
Did it never occur to you to question

459
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:41,462
your circumstances? You're only children.

460
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:44,379
Why would you be given such an extravagant sum?

461
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,671
Didn't you think there'd be a catch?

462
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,212
Your assumptions were wrong,

463
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:50,462
and now you must all pay the price.

464
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,796
If you did have doubts, why, then,

465
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,212
did you refuse to act upon them?

466
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,254
I told you on the first day of class, didn't I?

467
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,712
I was perfectly clear.

468
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:05,212
This school judges its students on merit alone, so.

469
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:10,087
As it stands now, we think you're all garbage.

470
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:13,504
You're worth nothing, so you get nothing.
