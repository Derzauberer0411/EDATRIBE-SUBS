1
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,750
I've always had trouble interacting with people.

2
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,333
I can't even bring myself to look them in the eye.

3
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,458
It scares me.

4
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,458
That's why I hide.

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,375
I use my mask to cover up my real self.

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,458
That way, it's harder for people to hurt me.

7
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,833
I'm okay being by myself.

8
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,458
It's safer that way.

9
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,375
I'm okay being lonely.

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,666
I can get over that feeling.

11
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,833
It's hot in here.

12
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,250
You're right,

13
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,125
and intense heat usually causes people to be irrational.

14
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
Which makes it the perfect place for a set-up.

15
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
Sudo'd be less likely to keep a cool head.

16
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,208
So, then. Have ya come up with a stellar plan yet?

17
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm in the brainstorming phase.

18
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,708
Sakura's testimony bought us time.

19
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,916
But we won't always be so fortunate.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,375
I just wish we could find some more substantial evidence

21
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,041
to seal the deal.

22
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,375
Oh, speakin' of which, this area doesn't have any.

23
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,000
Security cameras.

24
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,458
That's true.

25
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,125
If there'd been cameras, well,

26
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,083
then we would have all the evidence we need, wouldn't we?

27
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,416
Indeed.

28
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,708
On the other hand, if this area did have them up,

29
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,500
those jerks would never have summoned Sudo here

30
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,958
in the first place.

31
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,541
What's the matter?

32
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,000
I think I've come up with a plan.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,916
Sakura?

34
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,958
Oh, hey.

35
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,416
Good morning.

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Oh. Um...

37
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,541
Yes, good morning.

38
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,416
What's wrong?

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,166
You don't have to testify again, you know.

40
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,708
The hearing's private today.

41
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,083
So, there's no need for you to be so tense.

42
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,791
Okay.

43
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,666
And anyway, we have a plan.

44
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,125
If it works, we'll be able to save the whole class.

45
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,125
You're the one who made that possible.

46
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,291
I want to tell you that I trust you.

47
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,250
So if you ever happen to find yourself

48
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,291
in need of help,

49
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,083
just ask for me, and I'll be there.

50
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,916
I appreciate that.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,791
And I'm not the only one.

52
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sure that everyone in class trusts you, too.

53
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,500
Horikita, Kushida, Sudo, all of them.

54
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,041
Yeah.

55
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
Um. Listen.

56
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
I've got something on my mind.

57
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,000
There's really not much you could do

58
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,208
to help the situation, but I thought I'd try.

59
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,708
I'm sorry, Sakura.

60
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,083
I hate to cut you off,

61
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,458
but is there any way we could talk about this later?

62
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,166
Yeah.

63
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,208
So damn hot!

64
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,958
Why the special annex?

65
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,375
What do you guys think Kushida wants

66
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,583
to talk to us about, anyway?

67
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,208
I bet she's gonna ask me out!

68
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,875
Yeah, right, keep dreamin', ya big dummy.

69
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,416
Ah! Not so hard, jerk!

70
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,250
Let me go!

71
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,500
Huh?

72
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,416
Uh!

73
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,458
What the hell?

74
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,041
What are you doing in here?

75
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,958
You were expecting Kushida?

76
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,291
Huh?

77
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,250
That email she sent was just a ruse.

78
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,041
I told her to send it to you.

79
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,000
And why would you do that?

80
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,291
I wanted to have a chat.

81
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,500
It was the only way to get you here.

82
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,833
But, I'm glad I finally have your attention.

83
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
Listen, last time we got summoned here

84
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,083
was when Sudo beat us up. You know that's the truth.

85
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,875
Sudo needs to take his punishment like a real man.

86
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,291
We're out of here.

87
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,708
I'd stay if I were you.

88
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,958
If you leave now, you'll regret
it for the rest of your lives.

89
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,333
Do you really want to ruin your futures like that?

90
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,625
And what the hell is your problem, lady?!

91
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,666
Whatever.

92
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,666
Maybe you should be more observant.

93
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,708
What are you even talking about?

94
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,791
What's the matter?

95
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,083
You seem a little shaken up.

96
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,833
Is that a... security camera?

97
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,458
There's a science laboratory in the special annex.

98
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,083
They work with all kinds of hazardous chemicals in there,

99
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,416
so, of course there would be cameras.

100
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,208
But, how?

101
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,666
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,375
If there's footage from those cameras

103
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,750
of what happened in here,

104
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,583
they'd know Sudo's innocent and wouldn't

105
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,791
need to have a hearing in the first place.

106
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,416
And you would definitely have no reason

107
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,166
to tell us about it, either.

108
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,375
The moment that the incident took place,

109
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,916
both parties were doomed to
suffer some form of punishment.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,791
Regardless of why, the truth is that Sudo beat you up.

111
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,875
That is an indisputable fact.

112
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,500
Oh, so that's why we're here.

113
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,458
You guys would also be hurt by the camera recordings.

114
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,166
Of course, Sudo is still going to be punished,

115
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,000
but what you three did could get you all expelled.

116
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,583
You told a malicious lie

117
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,291
and got the whole school involved.

118
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,708
What did you expect would happen?

119
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,291
Oh, yeah?

120
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,041
If that's true, then why hasn't
the school said anything to us?

121
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,291
The school has a habit of testing its students.

122
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,833
They want to see if we can work out

123
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,541
some sort of truce on our own.

124
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,000
That's why they're taking a hands-off approach.

125
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,375
They want to see what we'll achieve

126
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,166
with the extra time we've been given.

127
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,166
I want you all to think back on the hearing yesterday.

128
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,458
Don't you think it seemed like
they already knew everything?

129
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,833
No way. I can't get expelled.

130
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,583
Ishizaki! Why don't we tell them we made it up.

131
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,916
If we have a solution,

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
maybe they'll be more lenient and not expel us!

133
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,208
What are we even supposed to do?

134
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,916
Shut up, you idiots!

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,458
Don't be too hasty in making your decision.

136
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,666
You know there is a way to save both of our classes.

137
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,708
If you're open to hearing it.

138
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,125
Like hell there's a way, jerk!

139
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,375
Why not take the entire incident off the table?

140
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,958
It's quite simple, really.

141
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,583
If you three would only withdraw your complaint,

142
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,458
it will be like nothing bad ever happened.

143
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,375
If no fight occurred here,

144
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,208
then how can the authorities punish anyone?

145
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,958
All we have to do is get our collective story straight,

146
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,625
then the school can't pursue it any further.

147
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,791
So, do we have a deal?

148
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,625
Hold on a minute.

149
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,333
I just have to talk it over with someone first.

150
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
Hey!

151
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,208
What's the matter, can't make
up your mind without your master?

152
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,375
Give it back!

153
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,250
How pathetic.

154
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,875
You bitch--

155
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,750
Resorting to violence?

156
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,708
Go ahead. Try it.

157
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,291
Dammit!

158
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,958
Ishizaki. Just admit it, we lost.

159
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,791
Let's accept Horikita's offer.

160
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,125
We can't afford to get expelled, dude!

161
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,583
Fine.

162
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,875
We'll take everything back.

163
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,666
Someone help.

164
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,833
You have my word that I'll pay back

165
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,625
the points I borrowed from you yesterday, with interest.

166
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,333
Let's discuss the terms.

167
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,500
You got it.

168
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,083
An eye for an eye, a lie for a lie, right?

169
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,916
Glad I could help.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,125
I never expected someone with a mind like yours

171
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,083
to be in Class D. I don't understand it.

172
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,750
Well, Horikita came up with the Machiavellian scheme.

173
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,416
I'm just some guy following orders,

174
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,083
to be perfectly honest with you.

175
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,750
Uh-huh.

176
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,333
Well, if you say so!

177
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,333
Sakura?

178
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,541
Hey, what's up?

179
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,333
Ayanokoji, help!

180
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:03,125
Shh! Be quiet.

181
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,916
Did you... Did you read all the letters I sent?

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,666
You've got to know how I feel about you, my darling.

183
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
Right?

184
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,875
So, why?!

185
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
Why have you been avoiding me like this?

186
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,625
If you know how precious you are to me,

187
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,625
why are you treating me this way?

188
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,208
You know how much I love you, right?

189
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,416
Someone help me...

190
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,958
So if you ever happen to find yourself

191
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,875
in need of help, just ask, and I'll be there.

192
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,916
Uh?

193
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,916
Let me go right now! Ah!

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,333
Dammit!

195
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,625
Listen.

196
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,541
If you don't let me do what I want,

197
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,708
I'll put the real you on the internet for everyone to see.

198
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,125
You wouldn't like that, huh?

199
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,791
Huh? What's going on?

200
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,375
Why are you looking at me that way, my darling?

201
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,000
Stop! Stop looking at me like that!

202
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,000
Stop it right now!

203
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,041
No! Let me go!

204
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,833
I'm going to show you

205
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
just how much I love you, darling.

206
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
I know you'll learn to love me, too, Shizuku.

207
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,208
You'll understand after this. Just be quiet.

208
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,125
We are destined to be together.

209
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,666
I know you feel the same way.

210
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,791
Local electronics store employee

211
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,125
caught in the act of sexual assault.

212
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,375
You're gonna be famous.

213
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,333
No, infamous is more accurate.

214
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,541
W-Wait a minute!

215
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,625
That's not what this is!

216
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,208
By all means, explain.

217
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,458
Remember, security cameras don't
lie, so be careful what you say.

218
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,166
Even if it was just an attempt,
she's still an underage girl.

219
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,375
With that on your record, you
would certainly lose your job.

220
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,458
The press is cruel.

221
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,375
They might even go after your family.

222
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,250
Face it.

223
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,541
As of this moment, your life is over.

224
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,250
You think you can get away

225
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,208
with committing such a heinous crime?

226
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,041
Something like that would never fly here.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
--Come quietly... --Let me go! She loves me!

228
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,708
I didn't do anything wrong!

229
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,958
You can't interfere with our love! It's destiny!

230
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,750
I'm Shizuku's number one fan!

231
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,333
She wants me, too!

232
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,791
Everything she does is because
of how much she cares for me.

233
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,291
She only updates her blog to show me her new pictures.

234
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,625
Why can't any of you see that?

235
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,625
She loves me, she just won't admit it!

236
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,958
She even came to this school so she could be close to me.

237
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,958
Shut up. I don't even know you!

238
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,416
What? What's the matter, Shizuku?

239
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,708
I want nothing to do with you.

240
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,916
A fan wouldn't treat me like this.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,958
Monster! I never want to see your face again.

242
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,958
I can't believe this.

243
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,625
You're a dirty liar.

244
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,375
You're ugly. This ugly bitch tricked me.

245
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,750
I'll make you pay for this!

246
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,500
Come on! You owe me an explanation, bitch!

247
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,541
I never could love an ugly, lying bitch like you!

248
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,166
Do you hear me?!

249
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,708
That's quite enough of that.

250
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,541
Damn you.

251
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
Damn you!

252
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,041
I'm sure Ichinose and the cops

253
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,333
can handle it from here.

254
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,208
I'm glad I had your contact info.

255
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,833
That's the only way I could have found you.

256
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,083
See? There you are.

257
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,750
I'm so sorry. I really am the worst, huh?

258
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,625
I thought I could make it on my own, but I can't.

259
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,708
Being an idol comes with its own set of hazards.

260
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,708
But I am grateful for one thing.

261
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,625
You guys. I'm so happy.

262
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,625
You like me for me.

263
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,791
I'm done lying. Sorry I didn't tell you before.

264
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,250
You have no reason to apologize,
but in the future, if you want

265
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,500
to talk to me about anything,
I promise I won't dismiss you.

266
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,708
I appreciate it.

267
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,875
Ayanokoji, um.

268
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,208
The look in your eyes.

269
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,208
I've never seen it in them before.

270
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,666
What do you mean?

271
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,541
Oh, nothing at all.

272
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,875
What do you want?

273
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,416
You called me out here to talk, so talk.

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,416
I'll get straight to the point.

275
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
How did you do it?

276
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,833
Sorry? How did I do what?

277
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,541
Don't play dumb.

278
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,083
We both know those imbeciles

279
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,083
wouldn't withdraw their complaint for no reason.

280
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,541
I'll leave that to your imagination.

281
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,125
I'll rephrase the question, then.

282
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,625
Who came up with the brilliant idea?

283
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,250
What made them back off?

284
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,250
I don't know.

285
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,208
Why does that even matter to you?

286
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,541
If you're truly serious

287
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,250
about advancing to Class A,

288
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,791
then allow me to offer you a simple word of advice.

289
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,916
Learn as much about Ayanokoji as you can,

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
while you still have the opportunity to do so.

291
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,916
Otherwise, before you know it, it'll be too late.

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,125
Hey, Ayanokoji!

293
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,500
How'd the hearing turn out?

294
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,791
You'll never believe what happened.

295
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,208
The guys in Class C, they
backed off for no apparent reason!

296
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,666
I see. That's incredible.

297
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,041
I know, isn't it?

298
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,791
Do you think Horikita pulled some strings for me?

299
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,875
Yeah, probably.

300
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,708
She's awesome. But also kinda weird.

301
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Well, I gotta go. See ya!

302
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,208
What is that supposed to mean?

303
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,083
Why do you imagine Ayanokoji

304
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,875
would be going out of his way to help the rest of you?

305
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,250
And why, despite his superiority,

306
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,291
does he refuse to reveal what he's capable of?

307
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,916
I don't know.

308
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,791
To put it in the school's terms,

309
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,041
Class D is the place for those with defective qualities.

310
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,083
The ones who barely had the chops to get in at all.

311
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,125
It's just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.

312
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,166
But out of everyone in Class One-D,

313
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,416
the most effective student

314
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,333
is Ayanokoji.

315
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,375
Uh.

316
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,375
The students from Class C
wanted to withdraw their complaint,

317
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,583
and against my better judgement, I allowed it.

318
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,791
Oh, did they, now?

319
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,250
It's a strange world we live in, I guess.

320
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you trying to prove a point?

321
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,208
That Sakura is not in fact the fabricator

322
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,250
everyone thinks that she is?

323
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,000
Well done, sir.

324
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,708
Your little sister is the one behind all of it.

325
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,916
I didn't do anything, really.

326
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,958
Tachibana. We have an opening for a secretary?

327
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,416
Yes.

328
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Well, then.

329
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,833
You just say the word,

330
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
and the secretary position on the council is yours.

331
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,458
What? Are you serious?

332
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,333
Do you object?

333
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,708
No. I was just making sure I understood.

334
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,041
I have no objections to that.

335
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,625
Ayanokoji.

336
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,000
Please join the student council.

337
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,375
No, thank you.

338
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,958
I don't like expending more energy than I have to.

339
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,333
The student council seems like too much work.

340
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,708
And honestly, I just want to have a normal life.

341
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,416
I accept that for now.

342
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,416
Ayanokoji.

343
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,083
It would be in your best interest not to disappoint me.

344
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,708
Which one of you was it?

345
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,083
Who withdrew the complaint without consulting me?

346
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,791
We... We're all responsible.

347
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,041
Well, Albert.

348
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,125
Sorry, boss's orders.

349
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,875
I've got no beef with you.

350
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,166
My plan was to get one of those idiots expelled,

351
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,958
to see how the school would react.

352
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,875
Now, I'll have to find another way.

353
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,458
You're all worthless.

354
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,916
It's entirely reasonable that
you should suffer for your sins.

355
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,125
Give me the names of the ones who set you up,

356
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,041
and Al will go easy.

357
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,833
Sakayanagi?

358
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,291
I recognize you. You're from Class C, aren't you?

359
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,333
It appears you think you've already been crowned

360
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,833
queen of the school. Well, that's just adorable.

361
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,458
I never intended to be queen of anything.

362
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,333
I'm going to crush Class D, and then Class B.

363
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,416
And before it's said and done,

364
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,291
I'm coming for Class A, too.

365
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,750
Do you really think you can make that happen?

366
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,791
There can be only one ruler here.

367
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,666
I couldn't agree more!

368
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,833
It's a relief that your little plan worked, isn't it?

369
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,916
You manipulated me, didn't you?

370
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,375
Admit it.

371
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,041
What do mean by that?

372
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,666
You pointed out the lack of cameras

373
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,416
in the special annex, which then led me to plant

374
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,833
the false evidence and bear all of the risk.

375
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,875
Nah, you're just overthinking it.

376
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,833
You made a promise to me.

377
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,666
You said that you would help me advance to Class A.

378
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,666
Yeah, only after you virtually forced me to.

379
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,666
Hold on.

380
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,041
I'm not quite finished with you yet.

381
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,416
I want to know what's going on inside your head.

382
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,791
What you're thinking.

383
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,208
Well, I just want to live my life in peace.

384
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,750
Is that so hard to understand?

385
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,625
You wouldn't help me if you didn't want to, deep down.

386
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,083
Yeah, you're right,

387
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,583
I suppose I just wanted to help a friend out. Ya happy?

388
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,083
That's a lie.

389
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,708
You've never cared about your friends, and you know it.

390
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,166
Who are you?

391
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,541
Really. What's your game?

392
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,875
Line up!

393
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,291
I will help you get to Class A, like I promised.

394
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,875
But...

395
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,416
But, what?

396
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,583
Don't go prying into my life.
