1
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,099
First, let's go over what we already know.

2
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:21,849
The school provided two tents that each sleep eight,

3
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:25,724
so we have some shelter, two
flashlights, one box of matches,

4
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,349
backpacks, and amenities for everyone in class.

5
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:30,974
And sunscreen for anyone who wants it.

6
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,099
A whole week with only the basics?

7
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,432
A survival test on a desert island, for real?

8
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,724
Just proceed as we discussed.

9
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,099
Right.

10
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,182
And get over yourself, too.

11
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,349
We both know that ever since the rumor went around

12
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,141
that you tried get into the student council

13
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:56,474
and got rejected,

14
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,349
Sakayanagi's faction has achieved dominance.

15
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,974
This is a great opportunity for the both of us.

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,349
So, we have to find our own food.

17
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:10,141
A test of survival, outdoors.

18
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,766
Ending at noon, one week from now.

19
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,141
But remember what the teachers told us?

20
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:17,391
We can still go swimming, have barbecues,

21
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,766
and all that other fun stuff.

22
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,599
No, we can only do that if we spend

23
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,099
the 300 S-points they gave us, which would be a waste,

24
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,141
considering what we could buy.

25
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:28,141
Food, drinking water, tools to cook with.

26
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:30,141
So you aren't gonna buy those things?

27
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,891
Look, if we have any S-points left at the end of the test,

28
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:35,516
then they'll be added to our class's total point score.

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,974
If we can tough it out for the whole week,

30
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:38,432
we'll get 30,000 a month!

31
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,974
Thirty thousand, guys!

32
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,432
What's that?

33
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,557
A list of things we could lose points for.

34
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,849
Illness and serious injuries.

35
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,432
Pollution of the surrounding environment.

36
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:53,099
Absence at morning and evening roll calls.

37
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:55,807
Violence against, or stealing from other classes.

38
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,349
But we can gain more points, can't we?

39
00:01:58,432 --> 00:01:59,599
Yes.

40
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,974
There are certain "spots" around the island

41
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:03,432
we can claim as our own to get bonus points.

42
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,432
"Freedom to choose," is the theme of this test.

43
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,432
Don't ya think?

44
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:07,807
Sure seems that way.

45
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,724
If we do this right, we could close the gap

46
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,724
between us and the other classes.

47
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,432
This thing is so restrictive.

48
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:17,016
But there's a penalty for removing the ID watches.

49
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,974
I don't think it's wise to risk it, y'know?

50
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,224
There are special sensors and GPS devices

51
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,057
hidden in these things.

52
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,349
So they can find us quickly
if there's an emergency, I bet.

53
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:29,266
Hey, Hirata, don't you think we should

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,849
be able to spend some of our points, within reason?

55
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:32,974
Hm...

56
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:34,516
No!

57
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,349
We should refrain from using points for as long as we can.

58
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,974
Don't you realize how difficult that's going to be?

59
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:40,474
Are we supposed to go to the bathroom in this?

60
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:41,599
I'll, like, die!

61
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,599
A basic toilet?

62
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,432
I'd prefer to tough it out.

63
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,891
That won't be a problem for me, personally,

64
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:51,099
but I don't think some of the other girls can.

65
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,641
A basic toilet.

66
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:56,099
You use a hyper-absorbent polymer sheet to solidify waste.

67
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,057
Each one can be used many times.

68
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,599
I think.

69
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,307
That might be hard on the women.

70
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,766
That's very likely.

71
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,474
Come on, we can just tough it out and use this toilet!

72
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,682
You're not listening!

73
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,932
I'm saying that some of the girls

74
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:10,141
might not be willing or able to do that!

75
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,516
We can buy a regular toilet with points.

76
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,807
See, it says so right here on the list.

77
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:16,766
That's perfect!

78
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:17,641
Yeah!

79
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,557
We totally have to!

80
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,682
Let's buy it right now!

81
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,432
You can't just decide that.

82
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,182
We shouldn't be able to spend collective points

83
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,641
without a majority vote.

84
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:26,057
A majority vote!

85
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:28,266
That's a great idea, Yukimura!

86
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,932
This is our chance to score some major class points!

87
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,891
We can do without the fancy toilet.

88
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:33,891
What the--?

89
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,307
Women are emotional creatures

90
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:37,266
who become irrational when they get triggered,

91
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,724
so you shouldn't indulge them, Hirata.

92
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,016
Say that again, jerk!

93
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,224
Hey, relax. Do you wanna prove the guy right?

94
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,474
Think about it from our perspective for a minute!

95
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,432
I'm not gonna go to the bathroom where...

96
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,974
This doesn't bode well.

97
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,224
This test is shaping up to be

98
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,474
much more complicated than I thought.

99
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,641
I don't know if we can cut it.

100
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,516
Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudo went on an expedition.

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,766
They're looking for a place to camp,

102
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,057
and any of those "spots" that were mentioned.

103
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,182
You're not having a good time?

104
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,391
This isn't exactly my forte.

105
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,266
On many levels: for one, roughing it.

106
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,307
And, two, having to be around people.

107
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,391
I can understand that.

108
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,516
Even though it pains me, I guess I've got to admit

109
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,891
the hypothesis you posed to me once upon a time

110
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:23,891
was eerily accurate.

111
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,641
This school will test us on a metric

112
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,682
involving more than academics.

113
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,266
That's what you said to me.

114
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,516
Yeah.

115
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,141
Ike and Sudo volunteered to go explore the forest

116
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,599
in search of a camp site.

117
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:38,432
I wouldn't even know how to handle that.

118
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:42,807
Are you going to be okay, despite everything?

119
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,641
Doesn't matter.

120
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:47,516
If Classes A and B are searching for these "spots,"

121
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,599
we would be wise to do the same. Don't you think?

122
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,516
Aiming for a higher class is harder than I thought.

123
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,724
Well, yeah, but don't you want what it offers?

124
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,016
What do ya mean?

125
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,391
The guarantee you'll get the job

126
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,182
or university you want.

127
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,182
I assumed that anyone who came to this school

128
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,432
did so because they wanted that.

129
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,807
A class of more than 20 people.

130
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,641
An unfamiliar basic toilet.

131
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:18,141
You really think there won't be any trouble?

132
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,724
We'll just have to make the best of it all.

133
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,182
Sharing a primitive toilet

134
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,766
is guaranteed to bring up problems.

135
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,474
I think spending points in moderation

136
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:28,057
is the best course of action.

137
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,974
Reckless self-deprivation and uncertainty

138
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:33,057
will stress everyone out, which increases conflict.

139
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,474
Not to mention the hygiene issues.

140
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,266
The girls need peace of mind.

141
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,682
It will make them more likely
to succeed in the exam. Y'know?

142
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,182
Yeah, you're right.

143
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:47,057
He would never argue against solid logic.

144
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,349
I think it's time for us to start searching the forest

145
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,682
for a good place to set up our base camp.

146
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,391
I agree.

147
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:55,099
Where we decide to camp will definitely

148
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:58,974
affect how and when we have to spend our points this week.

149
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,307
Are there any volunteers to help me search?

150
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,516
Oh, right here!

151
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,891
I'd be honored to help, if you'll have me!

152
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,266
Aren't you going to join the fun?

153
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,849
That's the last thing I wanna do.

154
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:18,891
And you?

155
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,766
Volunteering to help those guys look?

156
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,516
I've gotta say, I'm quite surprised.

157
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,474
Not taking any kind of role

158
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:27,724
makes you stand out from the group.

159
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,432
Thanks a lot, Sakura. That makes nine.

160
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,641
Let's proceed in teams of three.

161
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,974
Ah, yes, I am so beautiful.

162
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:50,266
And melding with the exquisite environment around me

163
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,432
only enhances my stellar looks.

164
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:55,141
I'm the pinnacle of beauty.

165
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,807
Excellent athletic ability, and no sign

166
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,266
of reticence about the outdoors, either.

167
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,349
What's his story?

168
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:06,307
Ayanokoji. Walking in this jungle.

169
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,057
It's pretty difficult, isn't it?

170
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:11,182
Yes, and it's incredibly hot, on top of that.

171
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,974
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

172
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:16,307
I'm fine. Don't worry!

173
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:17,307
Well, that's good.

174
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,391
Let's pick up the pace.

175
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,807
Uh, yeah.

176
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,682
Koenji sure is amazing, right?

177
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,724
Yeah, and it's not just his athleticism.

178
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:28,224
He's insanely confident all the time, too.

179
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,557
Koenji, wait! Don't go too fast, please.

180
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,766
No need to worry.

181
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,057
A little jungle like this is no match for me!

182
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:39,849
What's that supposed to mean?

183
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,016
As long as the sun is still shining,

184
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,891
there's very little chance of getting lost

185
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:46,349
while wandering around a forest like this one.

186
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,557
It's intriguing.

187
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,724
That's why I'm having the time of my life!

188
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,849
He keeps speeding up.

189
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,682
Koenji.

190
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,724
Don't worry about me, really. I'm okay.

191
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,932
Huh, lost sight of him again.

192
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,641
I wonder how fast that guy was
flying through the tree tops.

193
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,766
It's crazy.

194
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,141
Do you think this is one of the paths?

195
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:17,224
It certainly looks like it.

196
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:21,516
Wow.

197
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,599
I wonder if that cave is one of the spots they mentioned.

198
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,432
Most likely.

199
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:27,932
There are multiple "spots"

200
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,599
scattered throughout the island.

201
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:32,349
Each time you gain possession of one of these spots.

202
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:35,224
You will earn a single bonus point for your class.

203
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,849
However, you can't spend any bonus points

204
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,349
during the test period.

205
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,057
They'll be added to your class total

206
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,349
after the test has finished.

207
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:45,557
Each declaration of possession of a spot

208
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,307
lasts for eight hours.

209
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,266
Only the class leader has the authority

210
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,682
to declare possession.

211
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,057
You said class leader?

212
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,516
That's right.

213
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,141
This key card is used to take possession of a spot.

214
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,182
Only the leader gets one.

215
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,057
Also, you can't change leaders

216
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,641
without having a legitimate reason to do so.

217
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,599
In addition to that,

218
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:09,766
on the last day of the test, when we take roll,

219
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,724
for each class leader you are able to correctly identify,

220
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,391
your class will be allotted a whopping

221
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:17,682
50 bonus points, right then and there.

222
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,432
Fifty bonus points?

223
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,307
So if we guess all three classes' leaders,

224
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,099
we'll get 150 bonus points?

225
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,307
However, for each incorrect guess,

226
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,141
you'll lose 50 points.

227
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,724
This is a high-risk, high-return game.

228
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,932
It's in your best interest to try to find out

229
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:34,891
who the other class leaders
are, but also to make an effort

230
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,932
to conceal your leader's identity.

231
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,599
Spots are important, I guess,

232
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,391
but moving too hastily to secure them

233
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,057
could result in your leader being revealed.

234
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:07,849
We sure got lucky this time, right, Katsuragi?

235
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,391
Securing a spot like this so early in the week?

236
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,141
Lucky?

237
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:14,557
I've had my eye on it since before we landed.

238
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,766
Finding it was expected.

239
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,224
Another thing. Be careful what you say and do.

240
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,266
Oh, right.

241
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:25,016
We don't know who might be eavesdropping out here.

242
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:28,349
So, take extra care not to accidentally reveal anything.

243
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:30,349
As leader, it's my responsibility

244
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,891
to manage our class.

245
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:33,974
Yeah. I'll be careful.

246
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,849
Before we docked today,

247
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:39,641
the ship took a slow lap around the island at a distance.

248
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,307
That was a hint.

249
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,391
How was that a hint?

250
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,016
Even from that far away,

251
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,891
I could see there were paths cut through the jungle.

252
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,807
Then I knew I just had to find the shortest routes.

253
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,224
You could tell what the school

254
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,057
was trying to do just from that? Brilliant, as usual.

255
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,141
You know what?

256
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,016
Sakayanagi's got nothin' on you, dude.

257
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:00,641
Hold on for a second. Something's odd.

258
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,557
What is it, Katsuragi?

259
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,182
Um. What's up?

260
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,391
Nothing. Let's get moving.

261
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:27,474
We shouldn't stay here too long.

262
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:36,224
That was a close call.

263
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,557
Sorry, Sakura.

264
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,349
Sakura?

265
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:44,099
Are you okay?

266
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:45,557
I-I-I-I-I'm--

267
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,266
I'm okay.

268
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,349
Those two guys.

269
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,057
They're in Class A, right?

270
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,016
Uh, yeah.

271
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,807
Hey, Ayanokoji?

272
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,057
Does that conversation mean that bald guy

273
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:11,516
is Class A's leader?

274
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,516
So, we just learned an invaluable secret, didn't we?

275
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,849
Yeah.

276
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,266
I'll report it to Hirata later, when we get back.

277
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:21,224
He ditched you? Well, that's Koenji.

278
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,349
Yeah.

279
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,974
And it's not like I have the ability

280
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,807
to control a person like that.

281
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,307
As I'm sure you're aware.

282
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:30,641
Good news, everybody! Ike and the others.

283
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,349
They found a great spot at the head of a river!

284
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,266
Why don't we go meet up with them!

285
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,724
This is it!

286
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,057
Don't you think it's the best spot ever?

287
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:47,057
The water's so clear!

288
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:51,599
--Thanks, you guys. --It's beautiful!

289
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:53,224
It's a lot cooler than I thought!

290
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,807
You think we can drink it?

291
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,016
I know!

292
00:12:58,016 --> 00:13:00,099
There it is.

293
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,307
Useless to me.

294
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:06,432
Only the class leader can take possession of a spot. Huh.

295
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:09,682
So, assuming we wanna set up our base camp right here,

296
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,974
we had better discuss taking possession of it.

297
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,307
We should, shouldn't we?

298
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,682
If we do, we get unlimited access to the river,

299
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:19,557
and we'll also get points every eight hours!

300
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:21,766
Although, it isn't quite as simple as that.

301
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:23,974
The leader's gotta renew possession to get those points.

302
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,224
That's right. If another class sees them do it...

303
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,432
Can't we just, like,

304
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,474
surround them while they renew it?

305
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:33,266
Good idea! What do you guys think?

306
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,516
Yeah, that sounds like a plan!

307
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,724
We have enough people to block them.

308
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,099
Yeah, form a ring around them!

309
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,266
Last question then.

310
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,349
Who'll be our fearless leader?

311
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:42,516
Let's see.

312
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,474
I think Hirata should be our leader!

313
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,016
Hirata's the natural choice.

314
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,807
Hey, guys. I have something to say!

315
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,432
I've really been thinking about this a lot.

316
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,641
People like Hirata and Karuizawa stand out,

317
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:58,057
even if they don't intend to.

318
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,724
And the person we elect as our leader

319
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,724
should be someone who flies under the radar,

320
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,682
but they need to be responsible, too, right?

321
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:08,432
Only one of our classmates fits both requirements.

322
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,807
And, that person's Horikita.

323
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,391
What do you think?

324
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,141
I'm in favor!

325
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,932
Horikita, if you'll accept the
role, I'd like you to have it.

326
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,432
What do ya say?

327
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,557
If she won't,

328
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:26,891
I'd be happy to be the class leader.

329
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:30,891
Ugh, fine, then. I accept the position.

330
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,349
Ouch.

331
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,474
Okay!

332
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,641
That addresses the issue of bathing and drinking water

333
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,182
for the whole week. Huh?

334
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,349
Yeah. I guess.

335
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:51,849
It looks drinkable, anyway.

336
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,057
Are you sure this is safe to drink?

337
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,599
I mean, it is a river.

338
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,932
What if there's bacteria?

339
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,016
Can you tell?

340
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,599
What's the matter with you guys?

341
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:00,974
We found a freakin' river!

342
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,141
There's no way we're not going to use it!

343
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:05,141
We do have some time.

344
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,307
There's no need to make a hasty decision about it.

345
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:08,849
Uh, yeah!

346
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:09,932
He's right.

347
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,724
Kinda risky, don't you think?

348
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:17,016
Ike.

349
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,891
You have experience in the great outdoors?

350
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:21,224
Yeah, I do. My family loves camping

351
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:24,266
and we used to go every weekend when I was little.

352
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,932
I have no problem with drinking river water.

353
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:31,849
Sometimes you can tell if a spring is drinkable

354
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,599
just by looking at it.

355
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:48,474
Ayanokoji. Could I talk to you for a sec?

356
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:49,807
Before it gets dark,

357
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,557
I'd like you to gather some branches for us

358
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,849
to use as firewood tonight.

359
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,224
Yeah, okay. I'll get on that right now.

360
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,599
Wait! It's too dangerous for you to go on your own!

361
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:58,974
I'll find someone to help me.

362
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,266
Great!

363
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,849
Despite being the big man in Class D.

364
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:06,224
He still has to rely on you to help him.

365
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,807
Pathetic, isn't it?

366
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,307
It wouldn't kill you to help out a little,

367
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,182
too, fearless leader.

368
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,557
We both know there's nothing that I can help with.

369
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm useless right now.

370
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,724
But if an enemy or other objective turns up,

371
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,474
I'll be happy to offer my thoughts.

372
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,266
Hey. I'm gathering branches.

373
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,724
You could help.

374
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,266
Hm?

375
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:38,724
Listen, Ayanokoji.

376
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,474
I think I'm gonna go after Sakura.

377
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:44,057
Let's face it: Kushida is way out of my league.

378
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:44,932
Yes, and?

379
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,516
But a girl like Sakura--

380
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,516
if I can convince her that I'm a sensitive, caring guy,

381
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,224
I just know she'll fall for me.

382
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:56,016
Is that why you decided to tag along and help?

383
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,682
Hey, Sakura, are you tired?

384
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,391
Do you need help carrying those?

385
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:02,391
Must be such hard work for a girl,

386
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:04,016
and you might hurt your sweet little self.

387
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,474
Uh. It's fine I'm okay.

388
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:21,474
Hey, what's the matter?

389
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,641
Wha--? What the heck is your problem?

390
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,516
Oh. Nevermind, it's fine.

391
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,641
Hey, everything all right?

392
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:34,891
Just leave me alone. I don't need help.

393
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,266
You must be in a lot of pain, though.

394
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,641
You're Ibuki from Class C, right?

395
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:43,141
Did your classmates do something to you?

396
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,849
The three of us are students from Class D.

397
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:49,057
You can come back to our base camp with us, if you want.

398
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,266
Yeah.

399
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:52,682
Didn't you hear me?

400
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,891
I don't need your help.

401
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,474
And I'm in Class C, which means I'm your enemy.

402
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,766
We can't leave you out here all alone!

403
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:00,599
Right?

404
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:01,474
Mm-hm.

405
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:02,974
We'll stay right here with you.

406
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:05,349
When you can walk, we'll let you go.

407
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,182
How stupid can you be?

408
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,266
You shouldn't trust me.

409
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:12,766
No one in my class would dream of doing this.

410
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:17,016
You can't start a fire with branches alone, see?

411
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,474
But if you build it like this,
I think it'll light up nicely.

412
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,516
And there we go!

413
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,057
Experienced camper, huh?

414
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,141
You sure know your stuff!

415
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,016
That's the most basic of the basics!

416
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,516
Anybody can do it once they know!

417
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,849
That's pretty cool!

418
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,349
Hey, we're back!

419
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:44,266
Do you think... that this one's edible?

420
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,891
I don't know about that.

421
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,057
They could be blueberries!

422
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,016
Hey, those are bog bilberries!

423
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,766
Are you the one who found those, Kikyo? Awesome!

424
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,266
So, Kanji.

425
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,516
Do you know what those brown things are?

426
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,557
I'm pretty sure that those are figs!

427
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:00,516
They're deliciously sweet, like nothing else.

428
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,099
Man, this brings me back!

429
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,016
Oh, really?

430
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,182
Ike, you know all about this stuff.

431
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,307
It's so reassuring.

432
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,599
Check out the fire.

433
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,057
Ike started that, too.

434
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,599
Kanji, you really are amazing!

435
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:12,974
I agree!

436
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,724
He did such a great job starting the fire...

437
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:15,849
He found the river, too!

438
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,307
I'm grateful that we have someone

439
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,641
so experienced in our class!

440
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,932
Hey, Karuizawa. Sorry about before.

441
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:26,599
Wha--? Where did that come from?

442
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,432
I just remembered something.

443
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,391
The first time my family went camping,

444
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:31,974
the bathroom stuff was hard.

445
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:34,682
I complained to my parents the whole time.

446
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:37,266
It must be even harder for girls, right?

447
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,891
Ike can admit he was wrong

448
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:40,641
without getting worked up?

449
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:43,807
That's impressive. He's a better man than me.

450
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,682
I'm sorry, too, Ike.

451
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,391
We've gotta push our limits now and then

452
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:50,807
if we wanna have any points left at the end of all this.

453
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,724
Hey, you guys. Can I say something?

454
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,266
I think it's important for us
to trust and rely on each other

455
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,891
as much as possible until the end of this special test.

456
00:19:57,974 --> 00:19:59,099
So, here's my idea.

457
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,641
Of the 300 S-points,

458
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,599
let's aim to have 120 of 'em left by the end.

459
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,099
What do you guys say? Is that doable?

460
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:07,807
You mean you want to spend 180 points?

461
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,224
If we didn't have Ike, and had to buy it all,

462
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,266
food and water. That's every meal for

463
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,516
every single one of us for seven days.

464
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,307
The most efficient way would be the rations

465
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,766
and mineral water set.

466
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,016
It's ten S-points each for one meal for all of us.

467
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,432
What do you think?

468
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,224
He's pretty spot-on.

469
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,682
I've been turning those exact numbers

470
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,432
over in my mind all day.

471
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,557
Did you share that bit with Hirata?

472
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,474
Of course not. You're joking, right?

473
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:34,057
See?

474
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,724
A hundred and twenty S-points
is more than you might think.

475
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:38,057
After all, remember the test results from earlier?

476
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,641
Think of those numbers.

477
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:43,057
Class A's total points changed
by how much again? Uh, I forgot.

478
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,557
It was 94 points.

479
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,682
And that's if we do the very least.

480
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,932
For every day that we can find
food and water on our own...

481
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,057
...we'll be able to save 20 S-points on those days!

482
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,557
If we can make it the whole week without

483
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,057
buying drinking water, we can save

484
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,641
50 points that way alone.

485
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,891
Oh, that's good.

486
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,057
Let's give it a shot, Hirata!

487
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,599
All right, then, sounds good.

488
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,391
Let's all do our best!

489
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,891
Sorry about this.

490
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,641
Just a little bit longer.

491
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:15,682
See. Those guys by the fire.

492
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,266
They're discussing what to do with you now.

493
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,432
You shouldn't go out of your way.

494
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:23,141
It's just a matter of time before they cast me out.

495
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:24,724
I wouldn't be so sure.

496
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:26,557
We have a few trusting types.

497
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,557
Your name's Ibuki, right?

498
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,349
Here. You should eat.

499
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:37,182
You're all idiots. Every single one of you.

500
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,682
Oh, just eat. What harm is there in that?

501
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,307
We can have a talk later, too, if you're feeling up to it.

502
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:46,057
Damn that stupid punk! Koenji!

503
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:47,057
How could he do this?

504
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,599
He's a selfish jerk!

505
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,016
How will that affect our points...

506
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,557
What happened?

507
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:54,724
Koenji said he was feeling sick and went back to the boat!

508
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,182
According to the rules of the test,

509
00:21:57,266 --> 00:22:00,891
his illness alone will cost Class D 30 S-points.

510
00:22:00,974 --> 00:22:02,224
Koenji will be out of the game,

511
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,682
and he's required to stay on the ship and recover.

512
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,849
He can't come back.

513
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,391
Oh, no!

514
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,516
The moon is beautiful!
