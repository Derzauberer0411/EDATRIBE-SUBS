1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,029
What the--?

2
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:47,112
Ibuki, here.

3
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:50,154
I've acquired Class D's card, as directed.

4
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,779
Right.

5
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:56,196
Yes.

6
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:00,987
Yes, I see. We'll meet up there in a bit.

7
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:08,321
Class A's final score will be 544 points.

8
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:12,321
That's 350 ahead of Class B.

9
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,529
And it beats Class D's score by...

10
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:17,196
...an overwhelming number.

11
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:32,904
You're finally awake.

12
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:36,154
Where are we? How did I get here?

13
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,487
And why are we together?

14
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,696
I found you passed out in the forest.

15
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,904
I picked you up and brought you here.

16
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:47,987
I chased Ibuki to where you found me.

17
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:50,112
She's the one who took the key card.

18
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,321
But I wasn't able to get it back from her.

19
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,612
Not in this state.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,112
I see.

21
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,821
Horikita, you have to drop out.

22
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:03,612
I'll figure out a way to deal with

23
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,654
Ibuki and the stolen card.

24
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:08,237
You can't keep this up any longer.

25
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:09,654
I won't drop out.

26
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:12,612
We'll lose more points if I do, and we can't afford to.

27
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:13,779
Especially not now.

28
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:14,862
Look, you're sick--

29
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:17,196
I don't have any choice in the matter.

30
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,279
If we want to reach Class A.

31
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:21,196
Don't obsess about that.

32
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,904
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,904
I want to show my brother I'm not a loser.

34
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,446
But will that do you any good?

35
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,821
Do you think it will change anything?

36
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,821
I dunno. But still, this is all my fault.

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,446
If I had friends, we could
have carried the card in shifts.

38
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:45,237
But I don't. No one in class cares about me.

39
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,654
It's all my fault. I'm done for.

40
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:50,196
Do you mean to say that you're starting

41
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:53,196
to see the value in having allies?

42
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,279
I won't let this define me.

43
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:58,279
I swear to you. I'll make up for it.

44
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,821
I'll do it alone if I must.

45
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:02,029
You won't be able to do it alone.

46
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,237
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

47
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,821
but you aren't strong enough.

48
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,612
Are you saying I should give up?

49
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:11,321
No, that's not what I'm trying to say at all.

50
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,154
There's no need to give up.

51
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,654
If you can't win the battle alone,

52
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,862
then look for others who can help.

53
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,779
I'll be one of those people.

54
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,821
That's not like you.

55
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:28,029
You're usually so cryptic, and you...

56
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:40,071
Excuse me, ma'am?

57
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:44,029
Horikita. What happened?

58
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,196
She's had a bad fever,

59
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,487
and she just passed out because of it.

60
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,904
She needs to be somewhere she can rest.

61
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:54,529
She'll have to drop out of the exam.

62
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,696
Do you accept that loss?

63
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,029
Yes.

64
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,237
I heard that Horikita

65
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,696
dropped out of the test.

66
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,571
Ibuki's gone missing, too.

67
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,237
Do you think she was responsible for the arson after all?

68
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,404
But, why would she be?

69
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,196
I mean, what would that even accomplish?

70
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,946
Wait, do you think Ibuki could have been Class C's leader?

71
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,446
I have no idea.

72
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,737
But everyone else in Class C dropped out, right?

73
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,071
By now, their leader must be gone.

74
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,946
Our key card was stolen?

75
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,279
Yeah.

76
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,654
But I haven't told anyone else anything about it.

77
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:29,279
This confirms that Ibuki was sent to find our leader.

78
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,321
As for the underwear theft,

79
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,529
we can assume that was also her.

80
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,862
Why would she do that?

81
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:39,446
No, there's no use in trying to figure out why.

82
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,862
What we need to be concerned with now is tomorrow,

83
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:45,404
when they name our leader, and we lose those points.

84
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:46,987
The penalty from our drop-outs

85
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:50,946
and having our leader guessed
is a total loss of 110 S-points.

86
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,612
The fact that they know our leader will negate

87
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:54,737
all our bonus points, too.

88
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,404
And that will leave us with only about 50 S-points.

89
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,154
After the test results are revealed,

90
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,821
it won't take long for people to start blaming each other.

91
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,487
Yeah, might devolve into a bit of a witch hunt.

92
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,696
You know.

93
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,946
I thought this exam would give us the chance

94
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,154
we needed to bring our class together.

95
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,737
I thought that, if we could unify and do our best,

96
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,987
that it might help forge bonds between all of us.

97
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,362
But, no.

98
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,529
The reverse happened,

99
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,071
and this could be the end of Class D.

100
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,196
Hirata. I have a little favor to ask of you.

101
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,821
Before the test officially ends,

102
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,821
take a few moments to name who you think

103
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:43,237
the other class leaders are.

104
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:48,612
I haven't seen Kaneda...

105
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,737
All right, guys.

106
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,404
Write down on this form who you suspect

107
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,112
the other class leaders are.

108
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,362
If you don't have any idea, then leave it blank,

109
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:56,321
just to be safe.

110
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,737
That makes sense.

111
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,321
Should I just leave it blank, then?

112
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,862
Each wrong guess costs us 50 points.

113
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,446
I don't see any need to risk it.

114
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,654
Good call.

115
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,196
We have more than 200 points, anyway.

116
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:11,946
Um, hi.

117
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,779
The test is finally over.

118
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,487
Yeah. It's finally over.

119
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:18,404
Do you have any idea what our final score

120
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,404
on the exam will turn out to be?

121
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,946
There was that thing with Ibuki, you know?

122
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,571
Right! All remaining classes are here.

123
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,487
I formally declare the test complete.

124
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:34,321
All scores are in, and everything's final.

125
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:36,737
Hey.

126
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:39,196
You wouldn't say goodbye without me, would you?

127
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,779
What's Ryuen doing here?

128
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,737
You mean he stayed on the island, after all?

129
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,154
Ryuen's here, but Ibuki's not?

130
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,821
Yeah, why is that?

131
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,487
You did an excellent job, Ryuen.

132
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,821
You helped Class A earn over 500 S-points.

133
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:56,529
Allow me to offer a hand in gratitude for your hard work.

134
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,279
Just wait.

135
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:01,779
You're all about to witness something very interesting.

136
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:04,029
What do you mean by that?

137
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,279
If we hang a curtain over the entrance

138
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,446
to the cave, and hide everything in there,

139
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:13,779
then the other classes won't have a clue what we're doing.

140
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,612
This is a bold plan you've conceived.

141
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,029
Very risky.

142
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,487
And it's the only way I'll apply myself.

143
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,654
The school can shove its test.

144
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:24,821
I absolutely abhor hard work.

145
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,404
On the first day of the special exam.

146
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,987
I forged a contract with Class A.

147
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,529
Class C would buy and transfer 200 S-points'

148
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,779
worth of goods to Class A.

149
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,779
And, I would give any information Class C

150
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:40,612
collected on the other class leaders to Katsuragi.

151
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,987
Regarding the other leaders.

152
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,487
I will need more than just your word on their identity.

153
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:51,529
I need you to show me a photo of their key card.

154
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:54,237
That, or get me the card itself.

155
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,279
Right. Sure thing, man.

156
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:58,696
One thing though, when you form an alliance

157
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,196
with someone, shouldn't you trust them?

158
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,279
That's right. I need you to truly hate me.

159
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,696
'Cause If you don't...

160
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,446
...you won't fool anyone.

161
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:22,154
Take a hike.

162
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,362
Next, I sent Ibuki and Kaneda to work as spies.

163
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:28,862
Ibuki in Class D, and Kaneda in Class B.

164
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,612
Then came the revelry.

165
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,196
We spent all 100 of the S-points we had left

166
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,904
after the trade with Class A.

167
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,446
Then I had everyone except

168
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:46,279
Kaneda and Ibuki drop out. I alone remained.

169
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:49,404
I went into hiding, deep in the jungle.

170
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:55,196
You must really hate Katsuragi, am I right?

171
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
I was working with Sakayanagi's faction

172
00:08:57,362 --> 00:09:00,321
from Class A, too. One of the guys in that camp

173
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,612
was intentionally abusing a spot on the island

174
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:05,404
to reduce his own class's points.

175
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:08,571
He was human garbage, but remarkably forthright.

176
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:11,279
Enough to tell me who his class leader was.

177
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,154
What I hadn't planned for was Ibuki's

178
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:17,404
digital camera breaking.

179
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,612
It was an unfortunate kink in the works,

180
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,654
and forced Katsuragi and me to verify

181
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:23,946
Class D's key card in person.

182
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,237
It's genuine. Good job.

183
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,821
Your obligation is complete.

184
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,696
Care to know who Class B's leader is?

185
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,237
Naturally, B holds their cards close.

186
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,946
So all evidence is purely circumstantial.

187
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,237
Unless you have verifiable proof, I don't care.

188
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,571
Ryuen, you smell like a dead animal.

189
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:47,987
Take a shower, set yourself on fire, whatever works.

190
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:06,821
Ryuen. Are you there?

191
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,029
Is the test finally over?

192
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,321
Kaneda and Ibuki

193
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:17,404
have dropped out as well.

194
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:18,654
I see.

195
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:22,779
Anyway. Let's close this out.

196
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,446
Of course.

197
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:31,029
Class A's leader is Yahiko Totsuka.

198
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,987
B's is Chihiro Shiranami.

199
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,487
D's is Suzune Horikita.

200
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,362
Honestly now, you say that you hate it.

201
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,612
Any kind of exertion or hard work.

202
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,112
But, look at you.

203
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:45,904
You're like a soldier who's just fought an epic battle.

204
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:47,196
You're dirty, injured.

205
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,112
The others talk about your determination

206
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:50,446
in seeking victory.

207
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,196
Why don't you quit your babbling already, teacher.

208
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,487
Now that I've guessed every class's leader,

209
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,987
that will subtract 50 points from each of their scores

210
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,904
and negate their bonus points.

211
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,654
Class A will only gain a paltry 170 points

212
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,029
from this test.

213
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,821
As for Class C's points--

214
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,737
150 just from naming the leaders.

215
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:11,321
Combine that with the points we gained

216
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,654
from securing spots, and we'll beat Class A, for sure.

217
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:20,696
That means I win again.

218
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,862
And now, the time has come.

219
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:26,946
I will reveal the results of the special examination.

220
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,071
Coming in last: Class C, with zero points.

221
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:33,779
What?

222
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:36,571
Next, in third place: Class A,

223
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,362
with 120 points.

224
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,029
In second: Class B.

225
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:42,571
One hundred and forty points.

226
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:45,862
Finally, in first place: Class D,

227
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:48,571
with 225 points.

228
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:49,946
First place?

229
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,654
Huh, really?

230
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:53,112
We did it!

231
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,029
What on earth?

232
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,904
How could that have happened?

233
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:15,904
Well then, it looks like

234
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,529
you had a great time on the island.

235
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,112
Shut your mouth, Koenji!

236
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,237
You realize that we lost 30 whole point

237
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,404
because of you, right?

238
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,404
Oh, just calm down.

239
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,946
I was laid up with a very nasty cold, my good man.

240
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,696
What was I supposed to do?

241
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,654
You damn vain punk. Cut it out!

242
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,071
Dry off and stop glistening!

243
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,612
Wait up!

244
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,446
You better tell me exactly what's going on here.

245
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,737
It all played out more or less

246
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,696
the way I expected it would.

247
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,779
The Katsuragi faction is finished,

248
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:06,404
or they'll lose a great deal of influence, at least.

249
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,737
That's right.

250
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,696
And if we're united going into the second term,

251
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,404
then Class A is going to be unstoppable.

252
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,987
Katsuragi's here, so I'd better hang up.

253
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,904
Yes. Again, nice work.

254
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,112
How are you going to atone

255
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,196
for this one, Katsuragi?

256
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,112
Signing that contract

257
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:24,362
was an enormous mistake!

258
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:25,612
Don't forget every single one of you

259
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,654
signed off on it, too!

260
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:30,362
This is just pathetic, Katsuragi.

261
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:32,737
Hashimoto.

262
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,696
How dare you criticize Katsuragi

263
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,237
when you're probably the reason we failed!

264
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:40,446
I don't know what you did,
but why don't you try going to--

265
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,362
Hashimoto.

266
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,612
You spoke to Ryuen, did you not?

267
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,362
I know you sold the name of Class A's leader

268
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,404
to that opportunistic scumbag.

269
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,196
Second place, huh?

270
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,237
Yeah it is still a loss, unfortunately.

271
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:13,529
Class D really was the only clear winner in this exam.

272
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:16,321
Hey. Remember the first day?

273
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:19,529
What the teacher told us? She said to keep in mind

274
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,612
anything in this school can be bought with points.

275
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,071
Yeah. I do recall that.

276
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,987
It may be really expensive,

277
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,029
but it can still be bought.

278
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,654
You can be in any class you want,

279
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,571
if you pay the price.

280
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,612
I apologize.

281
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:54,196
Well. I've figured it out.

282
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,904
The reason they got that high score,

283
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:02,612
and why our score ended up being zero.

284
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,112
It's because we guessed it incorrectly.

285
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,487
Class D's leader.

286
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,821
What?

287
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:11,237
Well, you weren't our leader anymore, Horikita.

288
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:14,071
Wh-What? But the card!

289
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:20,612
What the...? What's your name doing on it?

290
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,029
Just before the test ended,

291
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:24,987
I had Class D's leader changed.

292
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,696
You can't just change leaders,

293
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,946
unless you've got a really good reason.

294
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,779
Which obviously means, if you
do have a really good reason,

295
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,779
you are allowed to switch.

296
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,737
Our leader's health was failing.

297
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,737
That's as good a reason as any.

298
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,029
Because of that, when Ryuen and Katsuragi

299
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,487
named you class D's leader, they were wrong.

300
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,154
It was me.

301
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:49,946
Wait, you conceived of this whole plan

302
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,904
by yourself, didn't you?

303
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:53,612
Yeah, I did.

304
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,446
I knew Ibuki was a spy,

305
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,987
so I destroyed her digital camera.

306
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,987
That meant she would have to steal the key card itself,

307
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,821
which would be much harder than taking a picture of it.

308
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,279
Then I waited until your condition

309
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,696
had sufficiently deteriorated.

310
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:14,196
I promise to give you Sakura's email address,

311
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,529
but you've gotta do something for me.

312
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:16,987
Ah?!

313
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,529
I got you to show me your card

314
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:22,362
while Ibuki was watching, staged a distraction,

315
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,987
got you to go to the waterfall.

316
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:28,612
And thus, Ibuki was lured into stealing your key card.

317
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:30,987
Then, I started the fire

318
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,862
to throw the camp into chaos.

319
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:36,071
Giving Ibuki the opening she needed to escape.

320
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:39,404
I knew their plan had always been for her

321
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:42,571
to sneak away from the camp and show Ryuen the card.

322
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:45,279
Then you convinced me that I should drop out,

323
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,529
and made yourself the leader.

324
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,529
Yeah, but that came later.

325
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:51,029
At first, I'd planned to amass points

326
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,654
by occupying all the spots.

327
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:55,279
But then I saw Katsuragi leaving

328
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,112
one of the spots with Class A's key card in his hand.

329
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,529
So, that means Class A's leader was Katsuragi?

330
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,821
No. Katsuragi is a cautious person.

331
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,029
He would never do anything that careless.

332
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,779
He wouldn't even occupy a spot when someone

333
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,654
might be around to see him.

334
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:13,529
It was just a performance to hide the truth.

335
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,237
That someone else had occupied the spot,

336
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:18,071
without checking it in with him first.

337
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,821
That's how I was able to infer

338
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,446
that Class A's leader was in fact Yahiko,

339
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:25,237
who was with Katsuragi at the time I saw him.

340
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,112
And as for Class C, I was well aware

341
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,862
that Ryuen had never actually left the island.

342
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,821
When we went to pay Ryuen a visit,

343
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:38,529
he had a two-way radio on the table next to him.

344
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,987
Ibuki was in possession of one just like it.

345
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,154
If Ryuen was indeed still in contact

346
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:48,112
with Ibuki that way, it meant
he still had to be on the island.

347
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:52,404
After that, I was certain that Ryuen was Class C's leader.

348
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,446
That's what made me change my tactics.

349
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,529
I switched from a spot occupation strategy

350
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,487
to a leader identification strategy,

351
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:00,821
and used you as a pawn.

352
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,654
But I left Class B alone.

353
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:04,654
I determined eroding our friendly alliance

354
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,696
with them would be detrimental to us in the long run.

355
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,779
And, to be honest,

356
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,821
there was already a spy in Class B.

357
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:12,904
So, I knew that their leader would be revealed,

358
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,404
even without any action on my part.

359
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,321
And you surmised correctly.

360
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,987
Their leader was identified, costing them serious points.

361
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,029
Yes, if another class guesses your leader,

362
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:26,029
it costs you 50 points, and all your bonus points

363
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:28,154
are negated, as well.

364
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:32,029
You really put one over on everyone this time.

365
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,446
But, I don't get it.

366
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,862
You claim to have no interest in ascending to Class A,

367
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,071
so why did you help me?

368
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,987
I can't figure out what motivates you.

369
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:42,987
Why do you do it?

370
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,154
There she is! Horikita!

371
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:48,362
We've been looking everywhere for you!

372
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,946
How did you do it?

373
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,529
We heard that you're the only
reason Class D won this thing!

374
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,529
Hirata told us everything you did!

375
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,112
He said that you're the one who figured out

376
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,737
who Class A and C's leaders were. That's awesome!

377
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,654
Thanks to you, we've got tons of points now!

378
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:03,904
You're amazing! What a genius!

379
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:05,237
--You guys, wait. --Ibuki was the one

380
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,904
who started the fire, and when she ran away,

381
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,279
you chased her in the rain, right?

382
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:09,446
--Um, well. --And he told us

383
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,821
that's the reason you're under the weather!

384
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:13,446
So cool! You're the best friend ever!

385
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,946
Friend? What are you talking about?

386
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,154
Horikita sure is popular, huh?

387
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,946
Yeah, I guess so.

388
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,571
I really do hate her.

389
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:32,779
Because, for better or for worse,

390
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:35,654
she has nothing to hide.

391
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,446
She and I are opposites. So...

392
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,821
Well, most people are more like you.

393
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,362
Me, included.

394
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,154
Hey, Ayanokoji?

395
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,821
What is it?

396
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:49,237
If you had to make a choice, like,

397
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,196
who you would be with...

398
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:56,112
You would choose Horikita, wouldn't you?

399
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,029
I don't know.

400
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,154
Meanie.

401
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,071
First, please allow me to congratulate you.

402
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:17,237
I am genuinely impressed.

403
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:19,571
Oh, so now you're satisfied?

404
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,487
Then tell me something.

405
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,362
Is it true that an outsider attempted

406
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,154
to get me expelled, or did you make that part up?

407
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:27,196
Hm.

408
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,112
I won't play this game, and I refuse

409
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,779
to do anything else for you until I have proof.

410
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:33,071
Have you forgotten that I know

411
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,987
every little thing about you? Come on, now.

412
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,571
Don't you think that that's proof enough?

413
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,904
Icarus' wings.

414
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:45,029
What about 'em?

415
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:48,029
Icarus wanted to fly in order to be free.

416
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:50,237
But he only did it because his father taught him

417
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:52,612
how to make the wings and take flight.

418
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:55,321
He couldn't have done it alone.

419
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,612
The poor boy wasn't flying of his own accord.

420
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:02,737
Now, don't you think that sounds a little bit familiar?

421
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,529
That man who called me,

422
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:07,446
who I am sure you've figured out by now is your father,

423
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:10,654
said, "Someday, Kiyotaka will choose to leave the school

424
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,737
of his own accord."

425
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:14,987
Fly too close, and you'll burn your wings,

426
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,821
then plunge into the sea and drown.

427
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:19,154
We both know that won't happen.

428
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,487
Poor, little Icarus.

429
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,112
What will your next move in our little game be?

430
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:28,154
I think you know the answer to that.

431
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:32,654
"Poor" Icarus? He didn't heed Daedalus' warnings.

432
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,071
You would have gotten

433
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:39,612
hundreds of thousands of points
every month until graduation?

434
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:42,112
From the very beginning, that contract was

435
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:44,029
the only thing I was after.

436
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:47,737
The bonus points were just a part of that goal.

437
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,112
However,

438
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,196
I don't like it when people try to get in the way

439
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,904
of what I want.

440
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,279
Class D.

441
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:09,987
I... I've been looking all over for you.

442
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,987
Oh, it's you again.

443
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,529
What do you want this time?

444
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,737
I heard from Hirata.

445
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:18,321
When you said who Class A and C's leaders were,

446
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,529
you also told him I was the one
who figured the whole thing out.

447
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,529
And then after the test was over,

448
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:25,696
you asked him to do something

449
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,612
to bring the class back together.

450
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,279
Are you trying to use me as some kind of cover?

451
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,529
Horikita, remember what I said to you

452
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:37,237
a long time ago? I told you that you need allies.

453
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,737
Is that why you did all of this?

454
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:43,946
I'm finally starting to see a real change in you.

455
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,529
Why's it always your fault?

456
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:49,404
Look, I acknowledge that we are allies,

457
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,703
but I'll only do it grudgingly,
so don't get any ideas, okay?

458
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,696
And you better not act like we're all buddy-buddy

459
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,362
once we get back to school, or trust me,

460
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:58,196
there'll be hell to pay!

461
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,946
It's just for our goals.

462
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,071
We're working together to get to Class A!

463
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:04,154
But...

464
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,654
Despite that, I have to tell you.

465
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,446
Thanks for your help.

466
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,862
Not that I need you or anything. I am fine without you!

467
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:15,612
But, Horikita.

468
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,987
I've never considered you an ally.

469
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,987
Not even for a second.

470
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:27,279
Not you. Not Kushida. Not Hirata.

471
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,737
People are nothing but tools to me.

472
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,737
All of them. I don't care what I have to do to win.

473
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:38,862
I don't care what I have to sacrifice.

474
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:42,321
In this world, winning is everything.

475
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:47,154
And in the end, I'm going to win.

476
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,529
That's all that matters.
